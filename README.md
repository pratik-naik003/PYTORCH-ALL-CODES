# Before PyTorch Existed...

Imagine you are working as an AI engineer in **2015**.

You want to create a neural network that can recognize handwritten digits.

The mathematical equation looks something like this:

\[
Y = W \cdot X + b
\]

where

- **X** = Input
- **W** = Weights
- **b** = Bias
- **Y** = Prediction

Now imagine your neural network has:

- 5 Layers
- 10 Million Parameters

After every prediction, you must manually calculate

- Gradients
- Partial derivatives
- Chain Rule
- Weight updates

For millions of parameters...

Every iteration...

For every training sample...

This quickly becomes impossible.

Researchers spent more time writing mathematical derivatives than building better models.

---

# The Need for Deep Learning Frameworks

Deep Learning Frameworks automate the difficult parts of neural network training.

Instead of calculating gradients manually, frameworks automatically compute them using **Automatic Differentiation (Autograd)**.

A framework handles:

- Tensor operations
- GPU computation
- Gradient calculation
- Neural network layers
- Optimizers
- Model saving/loading
- Training loops
- Distributed training

This lets developers focus on designing models instead of implementing calculus from scratch.

---

# What is PyTorch?

PyTorch is an **open-source Deep Learning Framework** developed by **Facebook AI Research (FAIR)**.

It provides tools for building, training, and deploying machine learning and deep learning models efficiently.

At its core, PyTorch is built around **tensors** and **automatic differentiation**, making it easy to implement everything from simple neural networks to state-of-the-art large language models.

---

# Official Definition

# PyTorch Ecosystem

PyTorch is more than a single library.

```text
                 PyTorch
                     │
 ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐
 │            │            │            │
torchvision torchaudio torchtext torchdata
 │            │            │            │
Images      Audio        NLP        Data Loading
```

Some commonly used libraries include:

- **torch** – Core tensor and neural network functionality
- **torchvision** – Computer vision datasets and models
- **torchaudio** – Audio processing
- **torchtext** – NLP utilities
- **torchmetrics** – Evaluation metrics

As you progress, you'll also use:

- transformers
- datasets

- peft
- trl
- unsloth

These libraries build on top of PyTorch for LLM development.

---

# Installing PyTorch

Always refer to the official installation page:

https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

At the time of writing, a common installation command is:

### CPU Version

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

### CUDA Version (Example)

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```

> **Note:** The CUDA version depends on your installed NVIDIA drivers and CUDA runtime. Always use the command recommended by the official website for your system.

---

# Create a Virtual Environment

Using a virtual environment keeps project dependencies isolated.

### Windows

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate it:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Linux / macOS

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate it:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

---

# Upgrade pip

# What We'll Learn Next

Now that the environment is ready, the next module focuses on the most important building block in PyTorch:

> **Tensors**

Every operation in PyTorch—whether it's a neural network, image processing, or an LLM—starts with tensors.

Understanding tensors thoroughly is essential before moving on to neural networks, autograd, or transformers.

# 📖 The Story Behind Tensors

Before learning PyTorch, let's understand **why tensors exist**.

Imagine you are building an AI model that recognizes cats in images.

A computer doesn't understand images like humans do.

When you open a picture like this:

```
🐱
```

You see a cat.

But the computer actually sees something like this:

```
[[255, 120, 35],
 [100,  90, 10],
 [220, 150, 80],
 ...
]
```

These are **numbers** representing pixel values.

Similarly,

A sentence like

```
I love AI
```

becomes

```
[105, 2034, 501]
```

Audio becomes numbers.

Videos become numbers.

Medical scans become numbers.

Everything inside Deep Learning eventually becomes **numbers**.

The question is...

**How do we efficiently store and manipulate millions (or even billions) of numbers?**

The answer is:

> **Tensor**

---

# Why Do We Need Tensors?

Suppose you want to train an image classifier.

Each image is

```
224 × 224 × 3
```

That means

```
224 × 224 × 3
=
150,528 numbers
```

If you train on

```
1000 images
```

you already have

```
150 Million+
numbers
```

Performing operations on such large datasets using Python lists would be extremely slow.

Tensors are optimized data structures that allow fast numerical computation, parallel execution, and GPU acceleration.

---

# What is a Tensor?

A **Tensor** is the fundamental data structure in PyTorch.

> **Definition:**  
> A tensor is a multi-dimensional array capable of storing numerical data and performing high-performance mathematical operations on CPUs and GPUs.

Think of tensors as the "containers" that hold data for machine learning models.

Everything in PyTorch—inputs, outputs, weights, gradients, and predictions—is represented as tensors.

---

# Real-Life Analogy

Imagine different ways of storing information:

| Data | Representation |
|-------|----------------|
| Single temperature | Scalar |
| List of marks | Vector |
| Excel sheet | Matrix |
| RGB Image | Tensor |
| Video | Tensor |
| LLM Training Data | Tensor |

As the complexity of data increases, we move from simple numbers to higher-dimensional tensors.

---

# Scalars, Vectors, Matrices and Tensors

## Scalar (0D Tensor)

A single value.

Example:

```
7
```

Temperature

```
32°C
```

Age

```
21
```

Python

```python
import torch

scalar = torch.tensor(7)

print(scalar)
```

Output

```
tensor(7)
```

---

## Vector (1D Tensor)

A collection of numbers.

Example

```
[10,20,30,40]
```

Python

```python
vector = torch.tensor([10,20,30,40])

print(vector)
```

Output

```
tensor([10,20,30,40])
```

---

## Matrix (2D Tensor)

Rows and Columns.

Example

```
[
 [1,2,3],
 [4,5,6]
]
```

Python

```python
matrix = torch.tensor([
    [1,2,3],
    [4,5,6]
])

print(matrix)
```

Output

```
tensor([[1,2,3],
        [4,5,6]])
```

---

# Tensor Dimensions (Rank)

Dimension tells us **how many axes** a tensor has.

| Tensor | Rank |
|----------|------|
| Scalar | 0 |
| Vector | 1 |
| Matrix | 2 |
| Image | 3 |
| Batch of Images | 4 |

Example

```python
scalar = torch.tensor(5)

print(scalar.ndim)
```

Output

```
0
```

---

Vector

```python
vector = torch.tensor([1,2,3])

print(vector.ndim)
```

Output

```
1
```

---

Matrix

```python
matrix = torch.tensor([
    [1,2],
    [3,4]
])

print(matrix.ndim)
```

Output

```
2
```

---

# Tensor Shape

Shape tells us

> **How many elements exist along each dimension.**

Example

```python
matrix = torch.tensor([
    [1,2,3],
    [4,5,6]
])
```

Shape

```
(2,3)
```

Meaning

```
2 Rows

3 Columns
```

Python

```python
print(matrix.shape)
```

Output

```
torch.Size([2,3])
```

---

Another Example

```python
image = torch.rand(3,224,224)

print(image.shape)
```

Output

```
torch.Size([3,224,224])
```

Meaning

```
Channels

Height

Width
```

---

# Number of Elements

Sometimes we need to know how many values exist inside a tensor.

PyTorch provides

```python
numel()
```

Example

```python
matrix = torch.tensor([
    [1,2,3],
    [4,5,6]
])

print(matrix.numel())
```

Output

```
6
```

Because

```
2 × 3 = 6
```

---

# Creating Your First Tensor

The simplest way to create a tensor is using

```python
torch.tensor()
```

Example

```python
import torch

numbers = torch.tensor([10,20,30])

print(numbers)
```

Output

```
tensor([10,20,30])
```

---

Matrix Example

```python
marks = torch.tensor([
    [80,90],
    [70,95]
])

print(marks)
```

Output

```
tensor([[80,90],
        [70,95]])
```

---

# Tensor Data Types

# 📖 The Story Behind GPU Computing

Let's travel back a few years.

Imagine you are training a simple neural network.

The dataset contains only

```
10,000 Images
```

Each image is

```
224 × 224 × 3
```

Your neural network has

```
15 Million Parameters
```

Every epoch requires

```
Forward Pass

↓

Loss Calculation

↓

Backward Pass

↓

Gradient Computation

↓

Weight Update
```

Now imagine repeating this process

```
100 Times
```

Your computer starts slowing down.

Training takes

```
Hours...

Sometimes Days...

Sometimes Weeks...
```

The problem wasn't the neural network.

The problem was the hardware.

Researchers realized that CPUs were never designed for performing billions of mathematical operations simultaneously.

A different type of processor was needed.

That processor was the **GPU**.

---

# Why CPUs Become Slow

A CPU is designed to perform many different kinds of tasks.

Examples:

- Opening applications
- Running operating systems
- Browsing the internet
- Playing music
- Managing files

Because of this, CPUs focus on being **versatile**, not on performing the same mathematical operation millions of times.

Deep learning, however, repeatedly performs operations such as:

```
Matrix Multiplication

Addition

Multiplication

Activation Functions

Gradient Calculations
```

These operations are highly repetitive and can be executed in parallel.

---

# What is a CPU?

CPU stands for

> **Central Processing Unit**

It is the brain of your computer.

A modern CPU typically has

```
4

8

12

16

24

32 Cores
```

Each core is extremely powerful and optimized for sequential execution.

Example

```
Task 1

↓

Task 2

↓

Task 3

↓

Task 4
```

One core completes one task before moving to the next.

This makes CPUs excellent for general-purpose computing.

---

# What is a GPU?

GPU stands for

> **Graphics Processing Unit**

Originally, GPUs were designed to render graphics for games.

Rendering millions of pixels requires performing identical mathematical operations simultaneously.

Manufacturers realized that this architecture is also perfect for deep learning.

Instead of a few powerful cores, GPUs contain **thousands of smaller cores** capable of executing many operations at once.

---

# CPU vs GPU

Imagine you need to solve

```
10,000 Math Problems
```

### CPU

You hire

```
8 Expert Teachers
```

Each teacher solves one problem at a time.

```
Teacher 1 → Problem 1

Teacher 2 → Problem 2

Teacher 3 → Problem 3
...
```

The teachers are very smart but there are only a few of them.

---

### GPU

Now imagine hiring

```
10,000 Students
```

Each student solves one simple problem.

```
Student 1 → Problem 1

Student 2 → Problem 2

Student 3 → Problem 3

...

Student 10000 → Problem 10000
```

Each student is slower than a teacher,

but because thousands work simultaneously,

the entire task finishes much faster.

This is exactly how GPUs accelerate deep learning.

---

# CPU vs GPU Comparison

| Feature | CPU | GPU |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Full Form | Central Processing Unit | Graphics Processing Unit |
| Number of Cores | Few (4–32) | Thousands |
| Optimized For | General Computing | Parallel Computation |
| Best At | Sequential Tasks | Matrix Operations |
| Deep Learning | Slow | Extremely Fast |
| Cost per Computation | Higher | Lower |

---

# Sequential vs Parallel Computing

### Sequential Processing

```
Task 1

↓

Task 2

↓

Task 3

↓

Task 4
```

One task finishes before the next begins.

---

### Parallel Processing

```
Task 1

Task 2

Task 3

Task 4

↓

All execute together
```

Deep learning relies heavily on parallel processing because matrix operations can be divided across many cores.

---

# Why Neural Networks Love GPUs

Consider multiplying two matrices:

```
1024 × 1024

×

1024 × 1024
```

This requires **millions of multiply-add operations**.

A CPU processes these operations using only a limited number of cores.

A GPU distributes the work across thousands of CUDA cores, allowing the computation to complete much faster.

The larger the model, the greater the performance benefit.

---

# What is CUDA?

CUDA stands for

> **Compute Unified Device Architecture**

CUDA is a platform developed by **NVIDIA** that allows programmers to use NVIDIA GPUs for general-purpose computation.

Without CUDA,

your GPU would mainly be used for graphics.

With CUDA,

the GPU can perform machine learning computations.

PyTorch communicates with CUDA to execute tensor operations on NVIDIA GPUs.

                       │

                NVIDIA Driver

                       │

                 NVIDIA GPU
```

When you write:

```python
tensor = tensor.to("cuda")
```

PyTorch sends the tensor to the CUDA runtime, which communicates with the NVIDIA driver and executes the computation on the GPU.

---

# CUDA Cores

CUDA cores are the small processing units inside an NVIDIA GPU.

Example:

| GPU | CUDA Cores |
|------|------------|
| RTX 3050 | 2560 |
| RTX 3060 | 3584 |
| RTX 4060 | 3072 |
| RTX 4090 | 16384 |

More CUDA cores generally allow more parallel computations, though memory bandwidth and architecture also matter.

---

# GPU Memory (VRAM)

Unlike CPUs, GPUs have their own dedicated memory called **VRAM**.

Examples:

| GPU | VRAM |
|------|------|
| RTX 3050 | 8 GB |
| RTX 3060 | 12 GB |
| RTX 4060 | 8 GB |
| RTX 4090 | 24 GB |

During training, VRAM stores:

- Model parameters
- Input tensors
- Gradients
- Optimizer states
- Intermediate activations

If the required memory exceeds available VRAM, you'll encounter an **Out of Memory (OOM)** error.

---

# NVIDIA Driver

The NVIDIA driver acts as the bridge between the operating system and the GPU.

Without the correct driver, PyTorch cannot communicate with the GPU.

---

# CUDA Toolkit

The CUDA Toolkit includes:

- CUDA Compiler (`nvcc`)
- Runtime Libraries
- Development Tools
- Debugging Utilities

It provides the software environment needed to build and run CUDA applications.

---

# What is cuDNN?

cuDNN stands for

> **CUDA Deep Neural Network Library**

It is a highly optimized library for deep learning operations such as:

- Convolutions
- Pooling
- Activation Functions
- Batch Normalization
- RNN Operations

Frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow use cuDNN internally to speed up neural network training.

---

# How PyTorch Uses CUDA

When you write:

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3], device="cuda")
```

PyTorch:

1. Creates the tensor.
2. Allocates memory on the GPU.
3. Transfers the data.
4. Executes future operations on the GPU instead of the CPU.

You don't need to write CUDA code yourself—PyTorch handles the interaction.

---

# Key Takeaways

- CPUs are optimized for general-purpose, sequential computing.
- GPUs are optimized for parallel numerical computations.
- Deep learning relies heavily on matrix operations, making GPUs ideal.
- CUDA enables NVIDIA GPUs to perform general-purpose computation.
- PyTorch uses CUDA to execute tensor operations on the GPU.

# 📖 Introduction

In the previous chapter, we learned that GPUs make Deep Learning significantly faster.

But simply owning an NVIDIA GPU isn't enough.

Your computer needs several software components that work together before PyTorch can use the GPU.

Think of it like driving a car.

Having the car alone isn't enough.

You also need:

- Fuel
- Engine
- Driver
- Roads

Similarly, PyTorch needs several components before it can communicate with your GPU.

---

# Understanding the Software Stack

When you execute

```python
tensor = tensor.to("cuda")
```

many things happen behind the scenes.

```
Your Python Code
        │
        ▼
     PyTorch
        │
        ▼
 CUDA Runtime Libraries
        │
        ▼
 NVIDIA Driver
        │
        ▼
 NVIDIA GPU
```

Every layer has an important responsibility.

If even one layer is missing,

PyTorch cannot use the GPU.

---

# What Do We Need?

To use GPU acceleration, we generally need:

✅ NVIDIA GPU

↓

✅ NVIDIA Driver

↓

✅ PyTorch (CUDA Build)

Notice something interesting.

You **do not always need to install the full CUDA Toolkit** just to train models.

Modern PyTorch wheels already include the CUDA runtime libraries they require.

---

# Step 1 — Check Your GPU

Before installing anything, verify that your computer actually has an NVIDIA GPU.

### Windows

Open

```
Task Manager

↓

Performance

↓

GPU
```

Example

```
GPU 0

NVIDIA RTX 4060
```

---

Another method

Open Command Prompt

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

If installed correctly, you'll see something like

```
+----------------------------------+

NVIDIA-SMI 580.xx

Driver Version: 580.xx

CUDA Version: 13.x

GPU Memory

Processes

+----------------------------------+
```

---

If you receive

```
'nvidia-smi' is not recognized
```

then either

- NVIDIA driver is missing
- Driver installation failed
- PATH issue

---

# Step 2 — Install the NVIDIA Driver

The driver is the bridge between your operating system and the GPU.

Without it,

PyTorch cannot communicate with the hardware.

Always download drivers from the official NVIDIA website:

```
https://www.nvidia.com/download/
```

Select:

- GPU Series
- GPU Model
- Operating System

Download

Install

Restart your computer.

---

# Verify Driver Installation

Open Command Prompt

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

Expected output

```
GPU Name

Driver Version

CUDA Version

Memory Usage

Temperature

Power Usage
```

This confirms your operating system can communicate with the GPU.

---

# Step 3 — Install PyTorch

Visit

```
https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
```

Choose

```
Operating System

Package Manager

Python

CUDA Version
```

The website automatically generates the correct installation command.

Example

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```

This installs the CUDA-enabled build of PyTorch.

---

# Why Don't We Install CUDA Toolkit First?

Many beginners think

```
CUDA Toolkit

↓

PyTorch
```

is mandatory.

In reality,

most users only need

```
NVIDIA Driver

↓

CUDA-enabled PyTorch
```

PyTorch ships with the CUDA runtime it needs.

You only need the full CUDA Toolkit when:

- Writing CUDA C++ code
- Building custom CUDA extensions
- Developing GPU kernels

---

# Step 4 — Verify Installation

Create

```
check_gpu.py
```

```python
import torch

print(torch.__version__)
```

Output

```
2.x.x
```

---

# Is CUDA Available?

```python
import torch

print(torch.cuda.is_available())
```

Output

```
True
```

means

PyTorch successfully detected your GPU.

If

```
False
```

then PyTorch is using the CPU.

---

# How Many GPUs?

```python
import torch

print(torch.cuda.device_count())
```

Example

```
1
```

If your workstation has multiple GPUs,

you may see

```
4
```

or

```
8
```

---

# Current GPU

```python
import torch

print(torch.cuda.current_device())
```

Output

```
0
```

GPU numbering starts from

```
0
```

---

# GPU Name

```python
import torch

print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))
```

Example

```
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060
```

---

# Complete Example

```python
import torch

print("PyTorch Version :", torch.__version__)
print("CUDA Available :", torch.cuda.is_available())
print("GPU Count :", torch.cuda.device_count())

if torch.cuda.is_available():

    print("Current GPU :", torch.cuda.current_device())

    print("GPU Name :", torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))
```

Example Output

```
PyTorch Version : 2.8.0

CUDA Available : True

GPU Count : 1

Current GPU : 0

GPU Name : NVIDIA RTX 4060
```

---

# Understanding CUDA Versions

Many beginners confuse these three versions.

There are actually three different version numbers.

```
NVIDIA Driver Version

↓

CUDA Runtime Version

↓

PyTorch CUDA Build
```

Example

```
Driver

580.xx
```

```
CUDA Runtime

13.0
```

```
PyTorch

cu128
```

These are related,

but they are **not the same thing**.

---

# Check CUDA Version Used by PyTorch

```python
import torch

print(torch.version.cuda)
```

Example

```
12.8
```

This shows the CUDA version against which PyTorch was built.

---

# Check cuDNN Version

```python
import torch

print(torch.backends.cudnn.version())
```

Example

```
9200
```

This confirms cuDNN is available.

---

# Device Object

Instead of writing

```python
"cuda"
```

everywhere,

PyTorch recommends using

```python
device = torch.device(
    "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available()
    else "cpu"
)
```

Now

```python
print(device)
```

Output

```
cuda
```

or

```
cpu
```

This makes your code portable across systems with and without GPUs.

# Common Problems

## Problem 1

```
CUDA Available : False
```

Possible Reasons

- NVIDIA driver missing
- Wrong PyTorch build
- Unsupported GPU
- Driver too old

---

## Problem 2

```
Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled
```

Reason

You installed the CPU-only version of PyTorch.

Solution

Install the CUDA-enabled wheel from the official PyTorch website.

---

## Problem 3

```
nvidia-smi not found
```

Reason

Driver isn't installed correctly.

---

## Problem 4

```
No NVIDIA GPU detected
```

Possible reasons

- Laptop using integrated graphics

- Hardware not present

---

# Best Practices

✅ Always install drivers from NVIDIA.

✅ Always copy the installation command from the official PyTorch website.

✅ Use virtual environments for projects.

✅ Check `torch.cuda.is_available()` before training.

✅ Write device-independent code using `torch.device()`.

# 🚀 What's Next?

In **Module 3 – Part 3**, we'll finally start using the GPU in code.

You'll learn:

- `tensor.to()`
- `.cuda()`
- `.cpu()`
- Moving entire models to GPU
- Common device mismatch errors
- Writing GPU-compatible training loops
- Performance tips and best practices

This is where your PyTorch programs begin taking advantage of GPU acceleration.


# Module 3 – CUDA & GPU Computing (Part 3)

> **Topic:** Moving Tensors & Models to GPU

**Goal**

By the end of this chapter you will learn

- Why tensors need to move to GPU
- What is `torch.device`
- How `.to()` works
- How `.cuda()` works
- How `.cpu()` works
- Moving complete models
- Device-independent programming
- Common CUDA errors
- Best Practices

---

# Story

Imagine you bought an expensive RTX 4090 GPU.

You installed

- CUDA
- PyTorch
- NVIDIA Drivers

Everything is ready.

Now you write

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([1,2,3])

print(x)
```

Output

```
tensor([1,2,3])
```

You think

> "Great! My GPU is working."

Actually...

**No.**

Your tensor is still stored inside **CPU RAM**.

Your GPU hasn't done any work yet.

Until you explicitly move a tensor to the GPU,

PyTorch continues using the CPU.

This is one of the biggest beginner mistakes.

---

# CPU Memory vs GPU Memory

Your computer has two different memories.

```
                Computer

          +-----------------+

          |     CPU RAM     |

          +-----------------+

                 ↑

          Stores Normal Data

                 ↓

          +-----------------+

          |    GPU VRAM     |

          +-----------------+

           Stores GPU Data
```

A tensor cannot exist in both places simultaneously.

It must be stored on

- CPU

OR

- GPU

---

# Why Move Tensors?

Suppose we have

```
Input Image

↓

Neural Network

↓

Prediction
```

If

Input is on CPU

and

Model is on GPU

PyTorch doesn't know how to perform operations.

Both must exist on the **same device**.

---

# Device

A **Device** tells PyTorch

> "Where should this tensor live?"

Possible devices

```
cpu
```

or

```
cuda
```

---

# Creating a Device Object

Instead of writing

```python
"cuda"
```

everywhere,

PyTorch recommends

```python
device = torch.device(
    "cuda"
    if torch.cuda.is_available()
    else
    "cpu"
)
```

Now

```python
print(device)
```

Output

```
cuda
```

or

```
cpu
```

---

# Why Use torch.device()?

Imagine

Laptop A

```
RTX 4060
```

Laptop B

```
No GPU
```

If your code contains

```python
tensor.cuda()
```

Laptop B will crash.

Instead,

```python
device = torch.device(
    "cuda"
    if torch.cuda.is_available()
    else
    "cpu"
)
```

works on both systems.

This is called

**Device Independent Programming**

---

# Moving Tensor to GPU

CPU Tensor

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([1,2,3])

print(x.device)
```

Output

```
cpu
```

Move

```python
x = x.to("cuda")
```

Now

```python
print(x.device)
```

Output

```
cuda:0
```

---

# Using Device Variable

Instead of

```python
x.to("cuda")
```

write

```python
x = x.to(device)
```

Advantages

- Portable
- Cleaner
- Recommended

---

# .to()

General Syntax

```python
tensor.to(device)
```

Example

```python
device = torch.device("cuda")

x = torch.tensor([1,2,3])

x = x.to(device)
```

---

# .cuda()

Shortcut

```python
x = x.cuda()
```

Same as

```python
x.to("cuda")
```

---

Example

```python
x = torch.tensor([10,20])

x = x.cuda()
```

Output Device

```
cuda:0
```

---

# .cpu()

Moves tensor back

```python
x = x.cpu()
```

Now

```
GPU

↓

CPU
```

Example

```python
x = x.cpu()
```

Output

```
cpu
```

---

# Complete Example

```python
import torch

device = torch.device(
    "cuda"
    if torch.cuda.is_available()
    else
    "cpu"
)

x = torch.tensor([1,2,3])

print(x.device)

x = x.to(device)

print(x.device)
```

Possible Output

```
cpu

cuda:0
```

---

# Creating Tensor Directly on GPU

Instead of

```python
x = torch.tensor([1,2,3])

x = x.to(device)
```

You can directly write

```python
x = torch.tensor(
    [1,2,3],
    device=device
)
```

Much faster.

---

# Multiple Tensors

```python
a = torch.rand(5,5).to(device)

b = torch.rand(5,5).to(device)

c = a + b
```

Everything happens on GPU.

---

# Checking Tensor Device

```python
print(a.device)
```

Output

```
cuda:0
```

---

# Moving Neural Network

Tensor is not enough.

The model also needs GPU.

Example

```python
model = MyModel()
```

Move

```python
model = model.to(device)
```

Now

Every layer

Every parameter

Every weight

moves to GPU.

# Device Independent Code

Always write

```python

    if torch.cuda.is_available()
    else
    "cpu"

```

Never

```python

```

Because

Someone may run your code

without GPU.

---

# Performance Tip

Bad

```python
for i in range(1000):

    x = x.to(device)
```

Good

```python
x = x.to(device)

for i in range(1000):

    prediction = model(x)
```

Move tensors only once whenever possible.

Everything stays on GPU.

If not,

---

# Best Practices

✅ Create one global device object.

✅ Move model only once.

✅ Move tensors before computation.

✅ Keep tensors on same device.

✅ Don't move tensors repeatedly.

✅ Use `.to(device)` instead of `.cuda()`.

---

# Common Mistakes

❌ Model on CPU

---

❌ Forgetting

```python
model.to(device)

# FP16 vs BF16

| Feature | FP16 | BF16 |
|----------|------|-------|
| Bits | 16 |16|
| Memory |2 Bytes|2 Bytes|
| Speed |Fast|Fast|
| Numerical Stability|Medium|High|
| Used in LLMs|Yes|Yes|
| Overflow Risk|Higher|Lower|

Modern LLM training prefers

```
BF16
```

whenever supported.

---

# Memory Comparison

Suppose

```
1 Billion Parameters
```

### FP32

```
1B × 4

=

4 GB
```

---

### FP16

```
1B × 2

=

2 GB
```

---

### BF16

```
1B × 2

=

2 GB
```

Immediately

Memory becomes

```
50%

Less
```

---

# Speed Comparison

| Precision | Speed |
|-----------|--------|
| FP64 | Slowest |
| FP32 | Standard |
| FP16 | Faster |
| BF16 | Faster |

Modern GPUs

```
RTX

A100

H100

L40

H200
```

contain hardware specially optimized for FP16/BF16.

---

# Why FP16 is Faster

Smaller numbers

↓

Less Memory Transfer

↓

Higher Throughput

↓

More Parallel Operations

↓

Faster Training

Memory bandwidth is often the bottleneck in deep learning, so reducing the amount of data transferred speeds up computation.

---

# Tensor Cores

Modern NVIDIA GPUs contain

```
Tensor Cores
```

These are specialized hardware units designed specifically for matrix multiplication.

Normal CUDA Core

```
General Computation
```

Tensor Core

```

Deep Learning
```

Tensor Cores achieve their best performance using

- FP16
- BF16
- TF32

---

# What is Mixed Precision?

Instead of training entirely in FP32,

we combine

```
FP16

+

FP32
```

or

```
BF16

+

FP32
```

Hence the name

```
Mixed Precision
```

---

# Basic Idea

Some operations require

```
High Accuracy
```

Others only require

```
High Speed
```

So

```
Forward Pass

↓

FP16

↓

Backward Pass

↓

FP16

↓

Weight Update

↓

FP32
```

Master weights are typically kept in FP32 for numerical stability while many computations run in FP16 or BF16.

---

# Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)

PyTorch provides

```python
torch.autocast()
```

which automatically chooses the appropriate precision for many operations.

Example

```python
with torch.autocast(device_type="cuda"):

    output = model(images)

    loss = criterion(output, labels)
```

You don't need to manually convert every tensor.

---

# Gradient Scaling

Small FP16 values can become

```
0
```

This problem is called

```
Gradient Underflow
```

PyTorch solves this using

```python
GradScaler
```

which scales gradients during training and rescales them before updating the weights.

---

# Advantages of Mixed Precision

✅ Faster Training

✅ Less GPU Memory

✅ Larger Batch Sizes

✅ Lower VRAM Usage

✅ Better GPU Utilization

✅ Essential for Large Language Models

---

# Limitations

❌ Some operations still require FP32

❌ Older GPUs may not benefit significantly

❌ Numerical instability can occur without proper scaling

---

# Real World Usage

Mixed Precision is widely used in:

- Llama
- Gemma
- Qwen
- DeepSeek
- Mistral
- Stable Diffusion
- Vision Transformers (ViT)
- CNNs such as ResNet and EfficientNet

It is considered a standard optimization in modern deep learning.

# Precision Summary

| Precision | Bits | Bytes | Speed | Memory | Typical Use |
|------------|------|-------|-------|--------|-------------|
| FP64 |64|8|Slow|High|Scientific Computing|
| FP32 |32|4|Normal|Medium|Standard Training|
| FP16 |16|2|Fast|Low|Mixed Precision Training|
| BF16 |16|2|Fast|Low|Modern LLM Training|
| INT8 |8|1|Very Fast|Very Low|Inference|

# 📖 Story

Imagine you trained a CNN on your laptop.

Everything works perfectly.

Now you upload the same project to

```
AWS

↓

RunPod

↓

Google Colab

↓

Kaggle
```

Suddenly your program crashes.

Error

```
Expected all tensors to be on the same device.
```

or

```
CUDA not available.
```

or

```
CUDA Out Of Memory.
```

The problem isn't your model.

The problem is **Device Management**.

A good PyTorch developer never writes code only for one machine.

They write code that runs on

- CPU
- Single GPU
- Multiple GPUs
- Cloud Servers

without changing the source code.

---

# What is Device Management?

Device Management means

> Managing where tensors and models are stored and where computations are executed.

Possible devices

```
CPU

GPU

Multiple GPUs
```

PyTorch gives complete control over device placement.

---

# Device Hierarchy

```

```

Large servers often contain

```

GPUs
```

---

# Creating a Device

Always create one global device object.

```python
import torch

device = torch.device(
    "cuda"
    if torch.cuda.is_available()
    else
    "cpu"
)
```

Never hardcode

```python
device = "cuda"
```

because your code will fail on systems without a GPU.

---

# Checking Current Device

```python
print(device)
```

Output

```
cuda
```

or

```
cpu
```

---

# Number of GPUs

```python
torch.cuda.device_count()
```

Example

```
2
```

Meaning

```
cuda:0

cuda:1
```

---

# Current GPU

```python
torch.cuda.current_device()
```

Output

```
0
```

---

# GPU Name

```python
torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)
```

Output

```
NVIDIA RTX 4060
```

---

# Tensor Placement

CPU Tensor

```python
x = torch.tensor([1,2,3])
```

Move

```python
x = x.to(device)
```

Now

```

```

---

# Model Placement

Every model has parameters.

Those parameters also live on a device.

```python
model = MyModel()

model = model.to(device)
```

Now every layer moves automatically.

---

# Data Loader

Inside training

Always move

```
Images

Labels
```

Example

```python
for images, labels in train_loader:

    images = images.to(device)

    labels = labels.to(device)
```

# Device Independent Programming

Good Code

```python
device = torch.device(
    "cuda"
    if torch.cuda.is_available()
    else
    "cpu"
)
```

Bad Code

```python
device="cuda"
```

Reason

Some users don't have GPUs.

---

# Why is .to(device) Preferred?

Instead of

```python
.cuda()
```

PyTorch recommends

```python
.to(device)
```

Advantages

- Cleaner
- Portable
- CPU Compatible
- Cloud Compatible

---

# Checking Tensor Device

```python
print(x.device)
```

Output

```
cuda:0
```

---

# Checking Model Device

```python
next(model.parameters()).device
```

Useful for debugging.

---

# Device Mismatch Error

Most Common Error

```
Expected all tensors to be on the same device.
```

Example

```
Tensor

↓

GPU

Model

↓

CPU
```

PyTorch cannot perform computation across different devices.

---

# Wrong Code

```python
images = images.cuda()

outputs = model(images)
```

```

Images

```

```

Runtime Error.

---

# Correct Code

```python
model = model.to(device)

images = images.to(device)

labels = labels.to(device)
```

Everything lives on

```
Same Device
```

---

# CUDA Synchronization

GPU operations are asynchronous.

This means

```
Python

↓

Continues

↓

GPU Still Working
```

Sometimes we need to wait.

```python
torch.cuda.synchronize()
```

Useful while

- Benchmarking
- Measuring Time

---

# GPU Memory

Every GPU has

```
VRAM
```

Used for

- Tensors
- Model Weights
- Gradients
- Optimizer States
- Activations

---

# Memory Usage

Current Memory

```python
torch.cuda.memory_allocated()
```

Reserved Memory

```python
torch.cuda.memory_reserved()
```

Maximum Memory

```python
torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated()
```

These functions help monitor VRAM usage during training.

---

# Clearing Cache

Sometimes memory isn't immediately released.

PyTorch caches memory for faster reuse.

You can clear unused cached memory with

```python
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

> Note: This clears cached memory, not memory currently used by active tensors.

---

# Out of Memory (OOM)

Example

```
CUDA Out Of Memory
```

Reasons

- Batch size too large
- Model too large
- Memory leak
- Multiple programs using GPU

---

# Fix OOM

✅ Reduce Batch Size

✅ Use FP16

✅ Use BF16

✅ Gradient Accumulation

✅ Gradient Checkpointing

✅ Close other GPU applications

---

# Monitoring GPU

Terminal

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

Shows

- GPU Usage
- Temperature
- VRAM
- Running Processes
- Power Usage

Useful while training.

---

# Multiple GPUs

Example

```
cuda:0

cuda:1

cuda:2

cuda:3
```

PyTorch supports

- Data Parallel
- Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)

DDP is the recommended approach for modern large-scale training.

---

# Good Training Loop

```python
device = torch.device(
    "cuda"
    if torch.cuda.is_available()
    else
    "cpu"
)

model = MyModel().to(device)

for images, labels in train_loader:

    images = images.to(device)

    labels = labels.to(device)

    optimizer.zero_grad()

    outputs = model(images)

    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

    loss.backward()

    optimizer.step()
```

This pattern is used in most PyTorch projects.

---

# Best Practices

✅ Create one global device object.

---

✅ Move model once.

---

✅ Move data inside training loop.

---

✅ Use `.to(device)`.

---

✅ Monitor GPU memory.

---

✅ Use Mixed Precision whenever possible.

---

✅ Keep tensors on same device.

---

# Common Mistakes

❌ Hardcoding

```python
device="cuda"
```

---

❌ Forgetting

```python
model.to(device)
```

---

❌ Labels on CPU.

---

❌ Calling

```python
.to(device)
```

inside every operation unnecessarily.

---

❌ Ignoring GPU memory usage.

# Story

Imagine you're training a neural network.

```
Image

↓

Prediction

↓

Loss

↓

Update Weights
```

But...

How does PyTorch know

```
Which weight

Should change

And

By how much?
```

Do we manually calculate

```
∂Loss/∂W1

∂Loss/∂W2

∂Loss/∂W3

...

Millions of derivatives?
```

Imagine Llama-3 with

```
8 Billion Parameters
```

Would you calculate

```
8 Billion derivatives
```

manually?

Impossible.

This is exactly why **Autograd** exists.

---

# What is Autograd?

Autograd is PyTorch's **automatic differentiation engine**.

It automatically

- Tracks operations
- Builds a computation graph
- Computes gradients
- Applies the Chain Rule

without us writing any calculus.

---

# What is a Gradient?

A gradient tells us

> **How much a parameter should change to reduce the loss.**

Imagine climbing a mountain.

```
Current Position

↓

Slope

↓

Move Downhill
```

Gradient is simply the slope.

Large Gradient

Large Update

Small Gradient

---

# Why Do We Need Gradients?

Suppose

```
Prediction = 10

Actual = 15
```

Loss

```

```

Should we

Increase weight?

Decrease weight?

Keep it same?

Gradient tells us the answer.

This repeats thousands of times.

---

# What is a Computational Graph?

Whenever we perform tensor operations,

PyTorch silently creates a graph.

Example

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True)

y = x * 3

z = y + 4
```

Internally

```
x

↓

×

3

↓

+

4

↓

z
```

PyTorch remembers

every operation.

---

# Why Build This Graph?

Later,

when we call

```python
z.backward()
```

PyTorch walks backwards

through this graph

computing gradients.

Hence the name

```
Backpropagation
```

---

# Forward Pass

Forward Pass means

```
Input

↓

Neural Network

↓

Prediction
```

Example

```python
x = torch.tensor(2.0)

y = x * 5

print(y)
```

Output

```
10
```

Simple.

---

# Backward Pass

Backward Pass computes gradients.

Example

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True)

y = x ** 2

y.backward()

print(x.grad)
```

Output

```
tensor(4.)
```

Why?

Because

```
y = x²

dy/dx = 2x

2 × 2 = 4
```

PyTorch did the calculus automatically.

---

# Chain Rule

Suppose

```
x

↓

×

3

↓

+

5

↓

Square
```

Instead of computing everything together,

PyTorch applies

```
Chain Rule
```

step by step.

This allows neural networks with millions of operations to compute gradients efficiently.

---

# requires_grad

Most important parameter.

Default

```python
False
```

Example

```python
a = torch.tensor(5.)

print(a.requires_grad)
```

Output

```
False
```

Now

```python
a = torch.tensor(
    5.,
    requires_grad=True
)
```

Output

```
True
```

Now PyTorch tracks every operation.

---

# Example

```python
x = torch.tensor(
    2.,
    requires_grad=True
)

y = x * 4

print(y)
```

Output

```
tensor(8.,
grad_fn=<MulBackward0>)
```

Notice

```
grad_fn
```

This means

Autograd is tracking the operation.

---

# grad_fn

Every operation stores

```
History
```

Example

```
MulBackward

AddBackward

PowBackward

ReluBackward
```

These functions help build the computation graph.

---

# Leaf Tensor

A tensor directly created by the user with `requires_grad=True` is called a **leaf tensor**.

Example

```python
x = torch.tensor(3.0, requires_grad=True)
```

`x` is a leaf tensor.

---

# Non-Leaf Tensor

```python
y = x * 2
```

`y` is not a leaf tensor.

It was created from another tensor.

---

# Computing Gradient

Example

```python
x = torch.tensor(
    3.,
    requires_grad=True
)

y = x ** 2

y.backward()

print(x.grad)
```

Output

```
6
```

Because

```
dy/dx = 2x

2 × 3 = 6
```

---

# Multiple Operations

```python
x = torch.tensor(
    2.,
    requires_grad=True
)

y = x * 5

z = y ** 2

z.backward()

print(x.grad)
```

Calculation

```
z=(5x)^2

=25x²

dz/dx

=50x

x=2

100
```

Output

```
100
```

---

# Gradient Accumulation

One very important concept.

Example

```python
x = torch.tensor(
    2.,
    requires_grad=True
)

y = x ** 2

y.backward()

print(x.grad)
```

Output

```
4
```

Now

```python
y = x ** 2

y.backward()

print(x.grad)
```

Output

```
8
```

Why?

Because

PyTorch **adds** gradients.

It does NOT replace them.

---

# Why Accumulate?

Useful for

Large Models

Small GPUs

Gradient Accumulation simulates larger batch sizes by summing gradients over multiple forward/backward passes before updating the weights.

---

# zero_grad()

To reset gradients

```python
optimizer.zero_grad()
```

Without this

Gradients continue accumulating.

---

# Training Loop

```python
for epoch in range(epochs):

    optimizer.zero_grad()

    output=model(x)

    loss=criterion(output,y)

    loss.backward()

    optimizer.step()
```

This is the heart of every PyTorch model.

---

# detach()

Sometimes

we don't want gradients.

Example

```python
x=torch.tensor(
    5.,
    requires_grad=True
)

y=x.detach()

print(y.requires_grad)
```

Output

```
False
```

Detached tensors are removed from the computation graph.

---

# Why detach()?

Useful when

- Logging values
- Saving predictions
- Converting to NumPy
- Freezing part of a computation

---

# torch.no_grad()

Turns off gradient tracking.

Example

```python
with torch.no_grad():

    prediction=model(images)
```

Everything inside the block is executed without building a computation graph.

---

# Why Use no_grad()?

During

```
Testing

Inference

Validation
```

We don't train.

So gradients are unnecessary.

Benefits

- Faster
- Less Memory
- Better Performance

---

# Difference

| detach() | no_grad() |
|----------|-----------|
| Single Tensor | Entire Block |
| Removes Graph | Doesn't Build Graph |
| Used During Computation | Used During Inference |

---

# Custom Autograd

PyTorch even allows you to create your own differentiable operations.

```python
from torch.autograd import Function

class Square(Function):

    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x):

        ctx.save_for_backward(x)

        return x*x

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):

        x, = ctx.saved_tensors

        return grad_output * 2 * x
```

This is useful for advanced research and custom mathematical operations.

---

# Common Mistakes

❌ Forgetting `requires_grad=True`

❌ Forgetting `optimizer.zero_grad()`

❌ Calling `backward()` twice without `retain_graph=True`

❌ Using `.numpy()` on a tensor that requires gradients (detach it first)

❌ Performing inference without `torch.no_grad()`

---

# Best Practices

✅ Use `requires_grad=True` only for trainable parameters.

✅ Always call `optimizer.zero_grad()` before `backward()`.

✅ Use `torch.no_grad()` during inference.

✅ Use `detach()` when gradients are not needed.

✅ Inspect `.grad` while debugging.

---

# Summary

- Autograd automatically computes gradients.
- Gradients tell the optimizer how to update weights.
- Computational graphs store every operation.
- `requires_grad=True` enables tracking.
- `backward()` computes gradients.
- Gradients accumulate unless cleared.
- `detach()` removes tensors from the graph.
- `torch.no_grad()` disables gradient tracking for inference.
- `optimizer.step()` updates model parameters.

# 📖 Introduction

So far, you've learned:

- Tensors
- CUDA
- Autograd

Now it's time to build **actual neural networks**.

Without `torch.nn`, you would have to manually create:

- Weights
- Biases
- Forward functions
- Gradient calculations

PyTorch simplifies all of this with the **`torch.nn`** module.

---

# What is `torch.nn`?

`torch.nn` is a module that provides everything required to build neural networks.

It includes:

- Layers
- Activation Functions
- Loss Functions
- Containers
- Model Utilities

Instead of writing neural networks from scratch, we use ready-made building blocks.

---

# Why Use `torch.nn`?

Without `torch.nn`

```text

Create Biases

↓

Write Forward Pass

↓

Compute Gradients

↓

Update Parameters
```

With `torch.nn`

```text

↓

Train Model
```

PyTorch automatically manages parameters and integrates with Autograd.

---

# What is `nn.Module`?

Every neural network in PyTorch inherits from `nn.Module`.

Think of `nn.Module` as the **base class** for all models.

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def forward(self, x):
        return x
```

Every custom model starts like this.

---

# Structure of an `nn.Module`

Every model has two main methods:

## 1. `__init__()`

Used to define:

- Layers
- Trainable Parameters

## 2. `forward()`

Defines how data flows through the model.

```text

---

# Your First Neural Network

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleNN(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(4, 8)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(8, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x
```

---

# Creating the Model

```python
model = SimpleNN()

print(model)
```

Output

```text
SimpleNN(
  (fc1): Linear(in_features=4, out_features=8)
  (fc2): Linear(in_features=8, out_features=2)
)
```

---

# What is a Layer?

A layer transforms input data into another representation.

Example:

```text
Input

↓

Linear Layer

↓

Activation

↓

Output
```

Common layers:

- `nn.Linear`
- `nn.Conv2d`
- `nn.Embedding`
- `nn.LSTM`
- `nn.BatchNorm`
- `nn.Dropout`

---

# Linear Layer

The most basic layer.

Mathematical equation:

\[
y = Wx + b
\]

PyTorch:

```python
layer = nn.Linear(5, 3)
```

Meaning:

- 5 input features
- 3 output features

---

# Passing Data Through a Layer

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(2, 5)

layer = nn.Linear(5, 3)

output = layer(x)

print(output.shape)
```

Output:

```text
torch.Size([2, 3])
```

---

# Activation Functions

A neural network without activation functions behaves like a single linear transformation.

Activation functions introduce **non-linearity**.

Common activations:

| Function | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| ReLU | Most common |
| Sigmoid | Binary classification |
| Tanh | Older networks |
| GELU | Transformers |
| Softmax | Multi-class output |

---

# ReLU

```python
relu = nn.ReLU()

x = torch.tensor([-2.0, 0.0, 3.0])

print(relu(x))
```

Output

```text
tensor([0., 0., 3.])
```

Formula:

\[
ReLU(x)=\max(0,x)
\]

---

# Sigmoid

Maps values between **0 and 1**.

```python
sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()
```

Commonly used for binary classification.

---

# Softmax

Converts outputs into probabilities.

```python
softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=1)
```

Example:

```text
Before

[2.1, 1.3, 0.5]

↓

After

[0.62, 0.27, 0.11]
```

---

# GELU

Used in modern Transformer models like:

- BERT
- GPT
- Llama
- Gemma
- Qwen

```python
gelu = nn.GELU()
```

---

# Forward Pass

The `forward()` function defines how input flows through the network.

```python
def forward(self, x):

    x = self.fc1(x)

    x = torch.relu(x)

    x = self.fc2(x)

    return x
```

Never call `forward()` directly.

Instead:

```python
output = model(x)
```

PyTorch automatically calls `forward()`.

---

# Model Parameters

Every layer has trainable parameters.

Print them:

```python
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    print(name, param.shape)
```

Example output:

```text
fc1.weight torch.Size([8,4])
fc1.bias torch.Size([8])
fc2.weight torch.Size([2,8])
fc2.bias torch.Size([2])
```

---

# Counting Parameters

```python
total = sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters())

print(total)
```

Useful for comparing model sizes.

---

# Using `nn.Sequential`

For simple networks:

```python
model = nn.Sequential(

    nn.Linear(4,8),

    nn.ReLU(),

    nn.Linear(8,2)
)
```

Advantages:

- Short
- Clean
- Easy to read

Limitations:

- Less flexible than custom classes.

---

# Custom Neural Networks

Preferred for real-world projects.

```python
class Classifier(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        self.features = nn.Linear(10, 20)

        self.output = nn.Linear(20, 3)

    def forward(self, x):

        x = torch.relu(self.features(x))

        return self.output(x)
```

---

# Typical Training Workflow

```text

↓

Model

↓

↓

Loss Function

↓

loss.backward()

↓

```

---

# Example Workflow

```python
model = SimpleNN()

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(
    model.parameters(),
    lr=0.001
)
```

Training:

```python
output = model(x)

loss = criterion(output, y)

optimizer.zero_grad()

loss.backward()

optimizer.step()
```

---

# Model Modes

Training mode:

```python
model.train()
```

Evaluation mode:

```python
model.eval()
```

Why?

Some layers behave differently during training and inference.

Examples:

- Dropout
- BatchNorm

---

# Saving Model

```python
torch.save(
    model.state_dict(),
    "model.pth"
)
```

Loading:

```python
model.load_state_dict(
    torch.load("model.pth")
)
```

---

# Best Practices

✅ Inherit from `nn.Module`

✅ Keep layers inside `__init__()`

✅ Define computations only inside `forward()`

✅ Use `model(x)` instead of `model.forward(x)`

✅ Call `model.train()` during training

✅ Call `model.eval()` during inference

---

# Common Mistakes

❌ Forgetting `super().__init__()`

❌ Creating layers inside `forward()`

❌ Calling `forward()` directly

❌ Forgetting `model.eval()` during inference

❌ Forgetting `optimizer.zero_grad()`

---

# 📖 Story

Imagine you're teaching a child to solve math problems.

The child answers

```
5 + 5 = 12
```

You immediately know

```
Wrong Answer
```

But the child asks

> "How wrong am I?"

Simply saying

```
Wrong
```

isn't enough.

You need to tell

- How far from the correct answer
- Whether the answer is improving
- Whether learning is happening

Deep Learning works exactly the same way.

The neural network makes a prediction.

Now we need a mathematical function that tells

```
How bad

or

How good

the prediction is.
```

That function is called the

```

Loss

The optimizer will try to reduce this error.

---

# Loss vs Cost

People often use these terms interchangeably.

Technically

Loss

```
One Training Example
```

Cost

```
Average Loss

Entire Dataset
```

Most libraries simply call everything

```
Loss
```

---

# Types of Problems

Machine Learning problems are mainly divided into

```
Regression

Classification
```

Different problems require different loss functions.

---

# Regression Losses

Used when predicting

continuous values.

Examples

- House Price
- Temperature
- Salary
- Stock Price

Popular Losses

- MSELoss
- L1Loss
- SmoothL1Loss

---

# Classification Losses

Used when predicting

categories.

Examples

- Dog vs Cat
- Spam Detection
- Digit Recognition
- Disease Detection

Popular Losses

- CrossEntropyLoss
- BCELoss
- BCEWithLogitsLoss
- NLLLoss

---

# Mean Squared Error (MSELoss)

Most common regression loss.

Formula

\[
MSE=\frac1n\sum(y-\hat y)^2
\]

PyTorch

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

criterion = nn.MSELoss()

prediction = torch.tensor([2.5])

target = torch.tensor([3.0])

loss = criterion(prediction, target)

print(loss)
```

Advantages

✅ Easy

✅ Smooth

Disadvantages

❌ Sensitive to outliers

---

# L1 Loss (Mean Absolute Error)

Formula

\[
|y-\hat y|
\]

PyTorch

```python
criterion = nn.L1Loss()
```

Advantages

- Robust to outliers

Disadvantages

- Less smooth gradients

---

# SmoothL1Loss (Huber Loss)

Combination of

```
MSE

+

L1
```

PyTorch

```python
criterion = nn.SmoothL1Loss()
```

Used in

- Object Detection
- Bounding Box Regression

---

# Binary Classification

Example

```
Spam

Not Spam
```

Only two classes.

Popular losses

- BCELoss
- BCEWithLogitsLoss

---

# BCELoss

Used after

```
Sigmoid
```

Example

```python
model

↓

Sigmoid

↓

BCELoss
```

PyTorch

```python
criterion = nn.BCELoss()
```

---

# BCEWithLogitsLoss

Recommended instead of BCELoss.

Why?

It combines

```
Sigmoid

+

BCELoss
```

into one stable operation.

PyTorch

```python
criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
```

Advantages

- Numerically Stable
- Faster
- Less Overflow

---

# Multi-Class Classification

Example

```
Cat

Dog

Horse

Lion
```

Only one correct answer.

Use

```
CrossEntropyLoss
```

---

# CrossEntropyLoss

Most popular classification loss.

Used in

- CNN
- ResNet
- Vision Transformer
- Llama Classifiers
- BERT Classification

PyTorch

```python
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
```

Example

```python
output = model(images)

loss = criterion(output, labels)
```

Important

Do **NOT** apply Softmax before `CrossEntropyLoss`.

PyTorch applies it internally.

---

# Why No Softmax?

Wrong

```python
output = torch.softmax(output)

loss = criterion(output, labels)
```

Correct

```python
loss = criterion(output, labels)
```

---

# NLLLoss

Negative Log Likelihood Loss.

Requires

```
LogSoftmax

↓

```

PyTorch

```python
criterion = nn.NLLLoss()
```

---

# KL Divergence Loss

Measures

Difference between

two probability distributions.

Used in

- Knowledge Distillation
- Variational Autoencoders
- LLM Training
- Reinforcement Learning

PyTorch

```python
criterion = nn.KLDivLoss()
```

---

# Choosing the Right Loss

| Problem | Loss |
|----------|------|
| Regression | MSELoss |
| Regression with Outliers | L1Loss |
| Object Detection | SmoothL1Loss |
| Binary Classification | BCEWithLogitsLoss |
| Multi-Class Classification | CrossEntropyLoss |
| Probability Distribution | KLDivLoss |

---

# Complete Example

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

prediction = torch.tensor([
    [2.1,1.2,0.5]
])

target = torch.tensor([0])

loss = criterion(prediction,target)

print(loss)
```

---

# Training Loop

```python
for images, labels in train_loader:

    optimizer.zero_grad()

    outputs = model(images)

    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

    loss.backward()

    optimizer.step()
```

Loss is calculated

every iteration.

# 📖 Story

Imagine you're standing on the top of a mountain.

Your goal is to reach the lowest point.

But there's one problem...

You are blindfolded.

You cannot see the valley.

The only information you have is

```
Which direction is downhill?
```

Every small step you take brings you closer to the bottom.

This is exactly how neural networks learn.

Instead of climbing a mountain,

they are trying to minimize a **Loss Function**.

The optimizer acts as the guide.

It tells the model

> **"Move your weights in this direction to reduce the loss."**

---

# What is an Optimizer?

An **Optimizer** is an algorithm that updates the model's parameters (weights and biases) using the gradients calculated during backpropagation.

Simple Workflow

Without an optimizer, the model cannot improve.

---

# Why Do We Need an Optimizer?

Suppose your model predicts

```
Prediction = 120

Actual = 100
```

Loss

```
20
```

Autograd computes the gradient.

But...

Who changes the weights?

The answer is

```
Optimizer
```

---

# Gradient Descent

The most fundamental optimization algorithm.

Goal

```
Reduce Loss
```

Formula

\[
W_{new}=W_{old}-LearningRate \times Gradient
\]

Meaning

```
New Weight

=

Each optimizer step moves closer to the minimum.

---

# Types of Gradient Descent

### 1. Batch Gradient Descent

Uses the **entire dataset** before updating weights.

Advantages

- Stable

Disadvantages

- Slow

---

### 2. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

Uses **one training sample** at a time.

Advantages

- Fast

Disadvantages

- Noisy updates

---

### 3. Mini-Batch Gradient Descent

Uses a **small batch** of samples.

Example

```
Batch Size = 32
```

Most Deep Learning models use Mini-Batch Gradient Descent.

---

# Learning Rate

Learning Rate determines

> **How large each optimization step should be.**

Notation

```
lr
```

Example

```python
lr = 0.001
```

---

# Choosing Learning Rate

Too Small

```
Very Slow Training
```

Too Large

```
Training becomes unstable

Loss may increase

Model may never converge
```

Good Learning Rate

```
Fast

Stable
```

---

# Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

Most basic optimizer.

PyTorch

```python
import torch.optim as optim

optimizer = optim.SGD(
    model.parameters(),
    lr=0.01
)
```

Advantages

- Simple
- Less Memory
- Easy to Understand

Disadvantages

- Can converge slowly
- May get stuck in local minima

---

# SGD with Momentum

Momentum helps the optimizer maintain direction and reduces oscillations.

Analogy

Imagine pushing a heavy ball downhill.

The ball gains momentum and rolls more smoothly.

PyTorch

```python
optimizer = optim.SGD(
    model.parameters(),
    lr=0.01,
    momentum=0.9
)
```

Advantages

- Faster convergence
- Smoother updates
- Escapes shallow local minima more easily

---

# RMSProp

RMSProp adjusts the learning rate for each parameter individually.

Idea

```
Frequently changing weights

↓

Smaller updates

Less changing weights

↓

Larger updates
```

PyTorch

```python
optimizer = optim.RMSprop(
    model.parameters(),
    lr=0.001
)
```

Used in

- RNNs
- LSTMs
- Reinforcement Learning

---

# Adam Optimizer

Adam stands for

```
Adaptive Moment Estimation
```

Adam combines ideas from

- Momentum
- RMSProp

It is the default optimizer for many deep learning projects.

PyTorch

```python
optimizer = optim.Adam(
    model.parameters(),
    lr=0.001
)
```

Advantages

✅ Fast

✅ Stable

✅ Works well for most problems

---

# AdamW Optimizer

AdamW is an improved version of Adam.

Main Difference

```
Adam

↓

Weight Decay implemented differently

↓

Better Regularization
```

PyTorch

```python
optimizer = optim.AdamW(
    model.parameters(),
    lr=0.001
)
```

Used in

- BERT
- GPT
- Llama
- Gemma
- Qwen
- Vision Transformers

Today, AdamW is the standard optimizer for training Transformer models.

---

# Weight Decay

Weight Decay is a regularization technique.

Purpose

Prevent the model from becoming too complex.

PyTorch

```python
optimizer = optim.AdamW(

    model.parameters(),

    lr=0.001,

    weight_decay=0.01
)
```

Benefits

- Reduces Overfitting
- Better Generalization

---

# Optimizer Comparison

| Optimizer | Speed | Memory | Common Use |
|------------|--------|---------|------------|
| SGD | Medium | Low | CNNs |
| SGD + Momentum | Fast | Low | CNNs |
| RMSProp | Fast | Medium | RNNs |
| Adam | Very Fast | Medium | General DL |
| AdamW | Very Fast | Medium | Transformers & LLMs |

---

# Creating an Optimizer

```python
import torch.optim as optim

optimizer = optim.Adam(

    model.parameters(),

    lr=0.001
)
```

---

# What is `model.parameters()`?

Every neural network contains trainable weights.

Example

```python
for param in model.parameters():

    print(param.shape)
```

The optimizer receives these parameters and updates them after every backward pass.

---

    optimizer.zero_grad()

    outputs = model(images)

    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

    loss.backward()

    optimizer.step()
```

This is the standard training loop in PyTorch.

---

# Why `optimizer.zero_grad()`?

Gradients accumulate by default.

Without resetting them

```python
optimizer.zero_grad()
```

the gradients from previous iterations would continue to add up, leading to incorrect updates.

---

# Checking Learning Rate

```python
print(
    optimizer.param_groups[0]["lr"]
)
```

Output

```
0.001
```

Useful for debugging and learning rate scheduling.

# When to Use Which Optimizer?

| Task | Optimizer |
|------|-----------|
| Beginner Projects | Adam |
| CNNs | SGD + Momentum |
| RNNs | RMSProp |
| Transformers | AdamW |
| LLM Fine-Tuning | AdamW |

# Best Practices

✅ Start with Adam for new projects.

✅ Use AdamW for Transformer-based models.

✅ Tune the learning rate before changing optimizers.

✅ Call `optimizer.zero_grad()` before `loss.backward()`.

✅ Save optimizer state when saving checkpoints.

---

# Saving Optimizer

```python
torch.save({

    "model": model.state_dict(),

    "optimizer": optimizer.state_dict()

}, "checkpoint.pth")
```

Loading

```python
checkpoint = torch.load("checkpoint.pth")

model.load_state_dict(
    checkpoint["model"]
)

optimizer.load_state_dict(
    checkpoint["optimizer"]
)
```

This allows training to resume from the last checkpoint.

---

# Common Mistakes

❌ Forgetting `optimizer.step()`

❌ Forgetting `optimizer.zero_grad()`

❌ Using an extremely high learning rate

❌ Choosing the wrong optimizer without experimentation

❌ Not saving optimizer state

# 📖 Story

Imagine you're training a model on

```
10 Million Images
```

Would you write

```python
image1 = ...

image2 = ...

image3 = ...

...

image10000000 = ...
```

Of course not.

Instead,

we need a system that can

- Read images from disk
- Read CSV files
- Read text
- Read videos
- Read audio

and provide them to the neural network

efficiently.

That system is

```
Dataset

+

DataLoader
```

---

# Why Data Loading Matters

A GPU can perform billions of operations per second.

But if the GPU waits for data,

training becomes slow.

```
GPU Waiting

↓

No Training

↓

Poor Performance
```

The goal is

```
Always Keep GPU Busy
```

PyTorch's DataLoader is designed for this purpose.

# What is a Dataset?

A Dataset is simply

> **A collection of training examples.**

Examples

```
Images

CSV Files

Text

Audio

Videos

Medical Records
```

PyTorch represents every dataset using

```
Dataset Class
```

---

# Built-in Datasets

PyTorch already provides

```python
torchvision.datasets
```

Popular datasets

- MNIST
- CIFAR10
- CIFAR100
- FashionMNIST
- ImageNet

Example

```python
from torchvision.datasets import MNIST
```

---

# Dataset vs DataLoader

# Custom Dataset

Most real-world datasets are custom.

To create one,

inherit

```python
Dataset
```

Example

```python
from torch.utils.data import Dataset
```

---

# Dataset Structure

Every Dataset needs

```
__init__()

__len__()

__getitem__()
```

---

# __init__()

Runs once.

Used for

- Reading file names
- Loading CSV
- Initializing variables

Example

```python
class MyDataset(Dataset):

    def __init__(self):

        pass
```

---

# __len__()

Returns

```
Total Number

of Samples
```

Example

```python
def __len__(self):

    return len(self.data)
```

---

# __getitem__()

Returns

```
One Sample
```

Example

```python
def __getitem__(self,index):

    return self.data[index]
```

This is the most important method.

---

# Complete Dataset Example

```python
from torch.utils.data import Dataset

class NumberDataset(Dataset):

    def __init__(self):

        self.data=[1,2,3,4,5]

    def __len__(self):

        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self,index):

        return self.data[index]
```

---

# Creating Dataset

```python
dataset = NumberDataset()

print(len(dataset))
```

Output

```
5
```

---

# Accessing Data

```python
print(dataset[0])
```

Output

```
1
```

---

# What is DataLoader?

DataLoader automatically

- Creates batches
- Shuffles data
- Loads multiple samples
- Supports multiprocessing

Instead of

```
One Image

↓

Model
```

we send

```
Batch

↓

Model
```

---

# Creating DataLoader

```python
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

loader = DataLoader(

    dataset,

    batch_size=2,

    shuffle=True
)
```

---

# Batch Size

Batch Size means

```
How many samples

go together
```

Example

Dataset

```
10 Images
```

Batch Size

```
2
```

Output

```
Batch 1

Image1

Image2

---------------

Batch2

Image3

Image4

---------------
```

---

# Iterating DataLoader

```python
for batch in loader:

    print(batch)
```

Possible Output

```
tensor([2,5])

tensor([1,4])

tensor([3])
```

---

# Shuffle

Training

```python
shuffle=True
```

Every epoch

Order changes.

```
Epoch1

1 2 3 4 5

Epoch2

3 5 1 4 2
```

Helps prevent overfitting to data order.

---

# num_workers

Controls

```
How many CPU

Processes

Load Data
```

Example

```python
DataLoader(

dataset,

num_workers=4
)
```

Higher values may improve throughput depending on your hardware.

---

# pin_memory

Useful for GPU training.

```python
DataLoader(

dataset,

pin_memory=True
)
```

Pinned memory can make CPU-to-GPU transfers more efficient.

---

# drop_last

Suppose

```
10 Samples

Batch Size=3
```

Output

```
3

3

3

1
```

Last Batch

Only

```
1 Sample
```

If

```python
drop_last=True
```

Last incomplete batch is discarded.

---

# Complete DataLoader

```python
loader = DataLoader(

dataset,

batch_size=32,

shuffle=True,

num_workers=4,

pin_memory=True
)
```

---

# Multiple Inputs

Dataset can return

```python
Image

Label
```

Example

```python
return image,label
```

Training

```python
for images,labels in loader:

    print(images.shape)

    print(labels.shape)
```

---

# Custom CSV Dataset

```python
import pandas as pd

class CSVDataset(Dataset):

    def __init__(self,file):

        self.df=pd.read_csv(file)

    def __len__(self):

        return len(self.df)

    def __getitem__(self,index):

        x=self.df.iloc[index,:-1].values

        y=self.df.iloc[index,-1]

        return x,y
```

---

# Image Dataset

```python
from torchvision.io import read_image

image = read_image(path)
```

Usually combined with

```
Transforms
```

such as resizing and normalization.

---

# Data Augmentation

Used to increase dataset diversity.

Examples

- Flip
- Rotate
- Crop
- Resize
- Normalize
- Color Jitter

```python
from torchvision import transforms

transform = transforms.Compose([

    transforms.Resize((224,224)),

    transforms.ToTensor()

])
```

---

# Collate Function

Default DataLoader stacks tensors into batches.

Sometimes

data has

```
Different Lengths
```

Example

- Sentences
- Documents
- Audio

A custom `collate_fn` lets you control how samples are combined into a batch.

```python
loader = DataLoader(

dataset,

collate_fn=my_collate
)
```

This is especially important in NLP and LLM training.

---

# Complete Training Example

```python
loader = DataLoader(

dataset,

batch_size=32,

shuffle=True
)

for images,labels in loader:

    outputs=model(images)

    loss=criterion(outputs,labels)

    optimizer.zero_grad()

    loss.backward()

    optimizer.step()
```

# Best Practices

✅ Use DataLoader instead of manual loops.

✅ Shuffle training data.

✅ Use appropriate batch size.

✅ Increase `num_workers` after testing performance.

✅ Use `pin_memory=True` when training on CUDA.

✅ Keep preprocessing inside Dataset or transforms.

---

# Common Mistakes

❌ Forgetting `shuffle=True` for training.

❌ Loading the entire dataset into GPU memory.

❌ Choosing a batch size larger than GPU memory allows.

❌ Performing expensive preprocessing inside the training loop instead of in the Dataset or transforms.

---

# 📖 Story

Imagine you have a student preparing for an exam.

The learning process looks like this:

```
Read Notes

↓

Attempt Questions

↓

Check Answers

↓

Find Mistakes

↓

Learn From Mistakes

↓

Repeat
```

A neural network learns in exactly the same way.

Instead of notes, it receives **training data**.

Instead of checking answers manually, it computes a **loss**.

Instead of remembering mistakes, it updates its **weights**.

This repeated learning process is called the **Training Loop**.

---

# What is a Training Loop?

A training loop is the repeated process of:

1. Reading a batch of data
2. Making predictions
3. Computing loss
4. Calculating gradients
5. Updating model weights
6. Repeating until the model learns

Without a training loop, a neural network cannot improve.

# Important Terms

## Epoch

An **Epoch** means

> One complete pass through the entire training dataset.

Example

```
1000 Images

↓

Model sees all 1000 images once

=

1 Epoch
```

---

## Batch

A **Batch** is a small subset of the dataset.

Example

```
Dataset

1000 Images

Batch Size = 100

↓

10 Batches
```

---

## Iteration

One iteration means processing **one batch**.

Example

```
Epoch = 1

Batch Size = 100

Dataset = 1000 Images

Iterations = 10
```

Relationship

```
Dataset

# Forward Pass

The input data is passed through the neural network.

```text
Input

↓

Model

↓

Prediction
```

PyTorch

```python
outputs = model(images)
```

---

# Loss Calculation

Compare prediction with actual labels.

```python
loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
```

Smaller loss

↓

Better model

---

# Backward Pass

Compute gradients.

```python
loss.backward()
```

Autograd calculates

```
∂Loss/∂Weight
```

for every trainable parameter.

---

# Optimizer Step

Update weights.

```python
optimizer.step()
```

Formula

```
New Weight

=

Old Weight

-

Learning Rate

×

Gradient
```

---

# Zero Gradients

Reset gradients before the next iteration.

```python
optimizer.zero_grad()
```

Why?

Because gradients accumulate by default.

---

# Order of Operations

Always follow this sequence:

```text
Forward Pass

↓

Loss Calculation

↓

Zero Gradients

↓

Backward Pass

↓

Optimizer Step
```

Common implementation:

```python
optimizer.zero_grad()

outputs = model(images)

loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

loss.backward()

optimizer.step()
```

---

# Training Loop Skeleton

```python
for epoch in range(num_epochs):

    for images, labels in train_loader:

        optimizer.zero_grad()

        outputs = model(images)

        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

        loss.backward()

        optimizer.step()
```

This pattern appears in almost every PyTorch project.

---

# Logging Loss

Monitor training progress.

```python
print(loss.item())
```

Example

```
Epoch 1

Loss = 2.31

Epoch 2

Loss = 1.65

Epoch 3

Loss = 0.82
```

A decreasing loss generally indicates learning.

---

# Complete Training Example

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

model = SimpleNN()

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

optimizer = optim.Adam(
    model.parameters(),
    lr=0.001
)

epochs = 5

for epoch in range(epochs):

    for images, labels in train_loader:

        optimizer.zero_grad()

        outputs = model(images)

        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

        loss.backward()

        optimizer.step()

    print(
        f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}"
    )
```

---

# Training on GPU

```python
device = torch.device(
    "cuda"
    if torch.cuda.is_available()
    else
    "cpu"
)

model = model.to(device)

for images, labels in train_loader:

    images = images.to(device)

    labels = labels.to(device)

    optimizer.zero_grad()

    outputs = model(images)

    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

    loss.backward()

    optimizer.step()
```

---

# Validation Loop

Training and validation are different.

Training

```
Weights Update

YES
```

Validation

```
Weights Update

NO
```

Example

```python
model.eval()

with torch.no_grad():

    for images, labels in val_loader:

        outputs = model(images)

        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
```

---

# Why `model.train()`?

```python
model.train()
```

Enables training behavior for layers like:

- Dropout
- BatchNorm

---

# Why `model.eval()`?

```python
model.eval()
```

Switches the model to inference mode.

Required before validation or testing.

---

# Saving the Model

```python
torch.save(
    model.state_dict(),
    "model.pth"
)
```

---

# Loading the Model

```python
model.load_state_dict(
    torch.load("model.pth")
)

model.eval()
```

---

# Saving Checkpoints

```python
torch.save({

    "epoch": epoch,

    "model": model.state_dict(),

    "optimizer": optimizer.state_dict()

}, "checkpoint.pth")
```

Useful for resuming training.

# Best Practices

✅ Shuffle training data.

✅ Move data and model to the same device.

✅ Use `optimizer.zero_grad()` every iteration.

✅ Call `model.train()` before training.

✅ Call `model.eval()` before validation.

✅ Save checkpoints regularly.

---

# Common Mistakes

❌ Forgetting `optimizer.zero_grad()`.

❌ Forgetting `model.train()`.

❌ Running validation without `torch.no_grad()`.

❌ Mixing CPU and GPU tensors.

❌ Saving the entire model instead of `state_dict()`.

---

# Cheat Sheet

| Step | Code |
|------|------|
| Training Mode | `model.train()` |
| Forward Pass | `outputs = model(images)` |
| Compute Loss | `loss = criterion(outputs, labels)` |
| Clear Gradients | `optimizer.zero_grad()` |
| Backward Pass | `loss.backward()` |
| Update Weights | `optimizer.step()` |
| Evaluation Mode | `model.eval()` |
| Disable Gradients | `with torch.no_grad():` |
| Save Model | `torch.save(model.state_dict(), "model.pth")` |

# 📖 Story

Imagine you are preparing for an exam.

You solve

```
100 Practice Questions

every day.

Eventually,

you memorize every question.

Now,

your friend gives you

```
20 Completely New Questions
```

If you score well,

Deep Learning models behave exactly the same way.

A model should **learn patterns**, not memorize the training data.

To check this,

we evaluate the model on **unseen data**.

---

# Why Do We Need Validation?

Suppose

Training Accuracy

```

```

Looks amazing.

But

Testing Accuracy

```

Something is wrong.

The model memorized

instead of

# Summary

- Validation measures how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
- Testing is used only for the final evaluation.
- `model.train()` and `model.eval()` control the behavior of certain layers.
- `torch.no_grad()` speeds up inference and reduces memory usage.
- Accuracy alone is not enough—precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC provide deeper insights.
- Early stopping helps prevent overfitting.
- Save the best-performing model based on validation performance.

# 📖 Story

Imagine you are training

```
Llama

7 Billion Parameters
```

Training takes

```
4 Days
```

After

```
3 Days

23 Hours
```

Power goes off.

Computer crashes.

Everything is lost.

Would you start again?

```
No.
```

Instead,

every few minutes

or every epoch,

you save

```
Model

Optimizer

Epoch

Loss
```

This saved information is called a

```
Checkpoint
```

Checkpointing is one of the most important concepts in Deep Learning.

---

# Why Save Models?

Training takes

```
Minutes

Hours

Days

Weeks
```

Examples

| Model | Training Time |
|--------|---------------|
| CNN | Minutes |
| ResNet | Hours |
| ViT | Days |
| Llama | Weeks |
| GPT | Months |

Without saving,

all progress is lost.

---

# What is state_dict()?

Every PyTorch model contains

```
Weights

Biases
```

PyTorch stores them inside

```
state_dict()
```

Think of it as

```
Dictionary

↓

Parameter Name

↓

Tensor
```

---

# Example

```python
for key, value in model.state_dict().items():

    print(key)
```

Output

```
fc1.weight

fc1.bias

fc2.weight

fc2.bias
```

---

# Why state_dict()?

Instead of saving

```
Entire Model
```

PyTorch recommends saving only

```
Weights
```

Advantages

✅ Smaller File

✅ Portable

✅ Faster

✅ Recommended by PyTorch

---

# Saving Model

Syntax

```python
torch.save(
    model.state_dict(),
    "model.pth"
)
```

Example

```python
torch.save(

    model.state_dict(),

    "best_model.pth"
)
```

Output

```
best_model.pth
```

---

# What is .pth?

`.pth`

stands for

```
PyTorch File
```

Common extensions

```
.pth

.pt

.ckpt
```

All are commonly used in PyTorch projects.

---

# Loading Model

Before loading,

first create

the model.

```python
model = SimpleNN()
```

Then

```python
model.load_state_dict(

    torch.load("best_model.pth")
)
```

Finally

```python
model.eval()
```

---

# Why model.eval()?

Loading weights

doesn't automatically

switch

to inference mode.

Always call

```python
model.eval()
```

before prediction.

---

# Saving Entire Model

Possible

```python
torch.save(

    model,

    "model.pth"
)
```

Loading

```python
model = torch.load(

    "model.pth"
)
```

---

# Why Not Save Entire Model?

Because

Entire Model

contains

```
Python Class

File Structure

Dependencies
```

Changing code later

may break loading.

Therefore

PyTorch recommends

```
state_dict()
```

---

# Saving Checkpoint

Real projects

save

```
Epoch

Model

Optimizer

Loss
```

Example

```python
torch.save({

    "epoch": epoch,

    "model_state_dict":
    model.state_dict(),

    "optimizer_state_dict":
    optimizer.state_dict(),

    "loss": loss

},

"checkpoint.pth")
```

---

# Loading Checkpoint

```python
checkpoint = torch.load(

    "checkpoint.pth"
)

model.load_state_dict(

    checkpoint["model_state_dict"]
)

optimizer.load_state_dict(

    checkpoint["optimizer_state_dict"]
)

epoch = checkpoint["epoch"]

loss = checkpoint["loss"]
```

Now

training continues

from the saved epoch.

---

# Resume Training

```python
for epoch in range(

checkpoint["epoch"],

100

):
```

Instead of

starting

from

```
Epoch 0
```

training resumes

from

```
Saved Epoch
```

---

# Saving Best Model

Suppose

Validation Loss

```
0.35

↓

0.31

↓

0.28

↓

0.30
```

Best model

is

```
0.28
```

Example

```python
if val_loss < best_loss:

    best_loss = val_loss

    torch.save(

        model.state_dict(),

        "best_model.pth"
    )
```

---

# Saving Optimizer

Optimizer

contains

```
Momentum

Learning Rate

Internal State
```

Always save

```python
optimizer.state_dict()
```

Otherwise

training won't continue

exactly where it stopped.

---

# Saving Multiple Models

GAN Example

```
Generator

↓

Save

Discriminator

↓

Save
```

```python
torch.save({

"generator":

generator.state_dict(),

"discriminator":

discriminator.state_dict()

},

"gan.pth")
```

---

# Saving Scheduler

If using

Learning Rate Scheduler

also save

```python
scheduler.state_dict()
```

---

# File Structure

```

```

---

# Saving on GPU

If model

trained on GPU

```python
torch.save(

model.state_dict(),

"gpu_model.pth"
)
```

Loading on CPU

```python
torch.load(

# Summary

- PyTorch recommends saving only the model's `state_dict()`.
- Checkpoints should include the model, optimizer, epoch, and loss.
- Use `model.eval()` before inference.
- `torch.load(..., map_location="cpu")` helps load GPU-trained models on CPU-only machines.
- Saving checkpoints regularly prevents losing training progress.
- Modern LLMs commonly use formats such as `.safetensors` to store model weights.

# 📖 Story

Imagine you are driving from Mumbai to Pune.

When you leave your home,

you drive normally.

```
80 km/h
```

As you reach Pune city,

you slow down.

```
40 km/h
```

Near your destination,

```
20 km/h
```

Why?

Because driving at

```
80 km/h
```

inside the city

would make you miss your destination.

Deep Learning works exactly the same way.

At the beginning,

the model should take

**large steps**

to learn quickly.

Later,

it should take

**small steps**

to fine-tune the weights.

This gradual adjustment is handled by a

> **Learning Rate Scheduler**

---

# What is Learning Rate?

Learning Rate determines

```
How much

weights change

after every update.
```

Formula

```
New Weight

=

Old Weight

-

Learning Rate

×

Gradient
```

Notation

```
lr
```

Example

```python
lr = 0.001
```

---

# What Happens if Learning Rate is Too High?

Suppose

```
Minimum Loss

↓

●
```

Instead of moving slowly,

the optimizer keeps jumping

from one side

to another.

```
●     ●

```

Result

❌ Doesn't Converge

---

# Too Small Learning Rate

```

Training may require

thousands of epochs.

---

# Ideal Learning Rate

---

# Why Use Learning Rate Scheduler?

Instead of

```

```

Schedulers automatically change

```

# Creating Optimizer

```python
import torch.optim as optim

optimizer = optim.Adam(

    model.parameters(),

    lr=0.001
)
```

---

# StepLR

Most basic scheduler.

Reduces learning rate

after every

fixed number

of epochs.

Example

```python
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import StepLR

scheduler = StepLR(

    optimizer,

    step_size=5,

    gamma=0.1
)
```

Meaning

Every

```
5 Epochs
```

Learning Rate becomes

```
Old LR × 0.1
```

---

# Example

Initial LR

```
0.001
```

Epoch

```

```
5

↓

```

---

# Using StepLR

```python
for epoch in range(20):

    train()

    scheduler.step()
```

---

# MultiStepLR

Instead of

every

5 epochs,

reduce only at

specific epochs.

```python
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import MultiStepLR

scheduler = MultiStepLR(

optimizer,

milestones=[10,20,30],

gamma=0.1
)
```

Learning Rate changes

only at

```
Epoch

10

20

30
```

---

# ExponentialLR

Reduce

every epoch

using exponential decay.

```python
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import ExponentialLR

scheduler = ExponentialLR(

optimizer,

gamma=0.95
)
```

Formula

```
LR

↓

LR × 0.95

for CNNs

and Transformers.

Learning Rate follows

PyTorch

```python
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import CosineAnnealingLR

scheduler = CosineAnnealingLR(

optimizer,

T_max=20
)
```

Advantages

- Smooth decay
- Better convergence
- Used in modern research

---

# ReduceLROnPlateau

One of the smartest schedulers.

Instead of

reducing every epoch,

it watches

```
Validation Loss
```

If

Validation Loss

doesn't improve,

Learning Rate decreases.

```python
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import ReduceLROnPlateau

scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(

optimizer,

mode="min",

factor=0.1,

patience=3
)
```

Meaning

If validation loss

doesn't improve

for

```
3 Epochs
```

↓

Reduce LR.

---

# Usage

```python
scheduler.step(

validation_loss
)
```

Unlike most schedulers,

this one receives

the validation metric.

---

# CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts

Instead of continuously decreasing,

learning rate periodically resets.

# Best Practices

✅ Monitor Learning Rate.

✅ Don't use

very large

Learning Rate.

✅ Use Warmup

for Transformers.

✅ Use Cosine Scheduler

for Deep Learning.

✅ Save Scheduler

inside checkpoint.

---

scheduler.state_dict()

},

"checkpoint.pth")
```

Loading

scheduler.load_state_dict(

checkpoint["scheduler"]
)
```

---

# Common Mistakes

❌ Forgetting

```python
scheduler.step()
```

---

❌ Calling scheduler

before optimizer

(for schedulers designed to step after optimizer updates or after each epoch).

---

❌ Using

ReduceLROnPlateau

without passing

validation loss.

---

❌ Forgetting

to save scheduler state.

# 📖 Story

Imagine you want to learn

```
Spanish
```

but you already know

```
English
```

Learning Spanish becomes much easier because

you already understand

- Grammar
- Sentence Structure
- Vocabulary Concepts

You don't start from zero.

Instead,

you reuse your previous knowledge.

Deep Learning works the same way.

Instead of training a model from scratch,

we reuse knowledge from a model

already trained on millions of images.

This idea is called

> **Transfer Learning**

---

# What is Transfer Learning?

Transfer Learning means

> Using knowledge learned from one task to solve another task.

Example

```
ImageNet

↓

ResNet

↓

Your Cat vs Dog Dataset
```

Instead of training

```
25 Million Parameters
```

from scratch,

we only train

a few layers.

---

# Why Do We Need Transfer Learning?

Training a Deep Learning model from scratch requires

- Huge datasets
- Powerful GPUs
- Long training time

Example

Training

```
ResNet-50

↓

ImageNet

↓

Millions of Images

↓

Days of Training
```

Instead,

we download

a pretrained model

and fine-tune it.

---

# What is a Pretrained Model?

A pretrained model is a model

that has already been trained

on a very large dataset.

Examples

```
ResNet

EfficientNet

MobileNet

DenseNet

ViT
```

Most computer vision models

are pretrained on

```
ImageNet
```

which contains

```
14 Million+

Images
```

---

# Why Do Pretrained Models Work?

The first layers of CNNs

learn

```
Edges

↓

Textures

↓

Shapes

↓

Patterns
```

These features are useful

for almost every vision task.

So,

instead of learning

them again,

we reuse them.

---

# Transfer Learning Pipeline

```
Large Dataset

↓

Train Model

↓

Save Weights

↓

New Dataset

↓

Load Weights

↓

Fine-Tune

↓

New Model
```

---

# Two Approaches

Transfer Learning mainly has

```
Feature Extraction

↓

Fine-Tuning
```

---

# Feature Extraction

Only train

the final layer.

Everything else

remains frozen.

```
Pretrained Layers

↓

Frozen

↓

New Classifier

↓

Train
```

Advantages

✅ Faster

✅ Less GPU Memory

✅ Small Dataset Friendly

---

# Fine-Tuning

Instead of training

only the last layer,

we also train

some of the pretrained layers.

```
Pretrained Model

↓

Unfreeze Last Layers

↓

Continue Training
```

Advantages

- Better Accuracy
- Learns Dataset Specific Features

---

# torchvision Models

PyTorch provides

many pretrained models

through

```python
torchvision.models
```

Popular models

- ResNet18
- ResNet50
- VGG16
- AlexNet
- DenseNet
- EfficientNet
- Vision Transformer (ViT)
- MobileNet

---

# Loading a Pretrained Model

```python
from torchvision.models import resnet18

model = resnet18(weights="DEFAULT")
```

PyTorch automatically downloads

the pretrained weights.

---

# Exploring the Model

```python
print(model)
```

This prints

all layers

of the network.

---

# Freezing Layers

Freeze means

```
Don't Update Weights
```

Example

```python
for param in model.parameters():

    param.requires_grad = False
```

Now

Backpropagation

will ignore

these layers.

---

# Checking Frozen Parameters

```python
for name, param in model.named_parameters():

    print(

        name,

        param.requires_grad

    )
```

Output

```
layer1.weight False

layer2.weight False
```

---

# Why Freeze Layers?

Imagine

```
25 Million Parameters
```

Training

all of them

requires

- More Memory
- More Time
- More Data

Freezing

reduces

training cost.

---

# Replace Final Layer

ImageNet

has

```
1000 Classes
```

Suppose

your dataset

has only

```
2 Classes
```

Replace

the final classifier.

Example

```python
import torch.nn as nn

model.fc = nn.Linear(

512,

2

)
```

Now

the network predicts

```
Cat

Dog
```

instead of

1000 ImageNet classes.

---

# Train Only Final Layer

```python
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(

model.fc.parameters(),

lr=0.001
)
```

Only

the new classifier

learns.

Everything else

remains frozen.

---

# Fine-Tuning Last Layers

Later

we may decide

to train

the final block.

Example

```python
for param in model.layer4.parameters():

    param.requires_grad = True
```

Now

Layer 4

also learns.

---

# Complete Example

```python
from torchvision.models import resnet18

import torch.nn as nn

model = resnet18(weights="DEFAULT")

for param in model.parameters():

    param.requires_grad = False

model.fc = nn.Linear(

512,

2
)

optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(

model.fc.parameters(),

lr=0.001
)
```

# Feature Extraction vs Fine-Tuning

| Feature Extraction | Fine-Tuning |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Freeze Backbone | Train Backbone |
| Fast | Slower |
| Less Data Needed | More Data Needed |
| Lower GPU Usage | Higher GPU Usage |

# Best Practices

✅ Start with pretrained models.

✅ Freeze layers when dataset is small.

✅ Replace the classifier layer.

✅ Use a lower learning rate for fine-tuning.

✅ Unfreeze gradually if needed.

---

# Common Mistakes

❌ Forgetting to replace the final layer.

❌ Training all parameters unnecessarily.

❌ Using a high learning rate during fine-tuning.

❌ Forgetting to freeze pretrained layers.

---

# Cheat Sheet

| Task | Code |
|------|------|
| Load Model | `resnet18(weights="DEFAULT")` |
| Freeze Layers | `param.requires_grad=False` |
| Replace Classifier | `model.fc = nn.Linear(...)` |
| Train Head Only | `optimizer = Adam(model.fc.parameters())` |
| Unfreeze Layers | `param.requires_grad=True` |

---

# Summary

- Transfer Learning reuses knowledge from pretrained models.
- Feature Extraction freezes most of the model and trains only the final layers.
- Fine-Tuning updates some or all pretrained layers.
- Pretrained models reduce training time and data requirements.
- Transfer Learning is used in both Computer Vision and NLP.
- Modern LLM fine-tuning is a form of Transfer Learning.

# 📖 Story

Imagine someone shows you this image.

🐱 Cat

Do you analyze

```
Every Pixel

at the same time?
```

No.

First,

your eyes notice

```
Edges

↓

Shapes

↓

Eyes

↓

Ears

↓

Face

↓

Entire Cat
```

Humans recognize objects

hierarchically.

CNNs do exactly the same thing.

Instead of memorizing pixels,

they learn

small visual patterns first,

then combine them into

complex objects.

---

# What is an Image?

A computer doesn't see

```
Dog

Cat

Car
```

It only sees

Numbers.

Example

Grayscale Image

```
28 × 28
```

Meaning

```
784 Pixels
```

Each pixel stores

```
0

↓

255
```

Example

```
0

Black
```

```
255

White
```

---

# RGB Images

Color images contain

3 channels.

```
Red

Green

Blue
```

Shape

```
Height

×

×

Channels
```

Example

```
224 × 224 × 3
```

PyTorch stores images as

```
Channels

×

Height

×

Width
```

Example

```
3 × 224 × 224
```

---

# Why Not Use Fully Connected Layers?

Suppose

Input Image

```
224 × 224 × 3
```

Total Pixels

```
224 × 224 × 3

=

150,528
```

A single Linear Layer

```
150528

↓

1000
```

Parameters

```
150 Million+

Weights
```

Problems

❌ Huge Memory

❌ Slow

❌ Overfitting

❌ Ignores Spatial Information

CNN solves all these problems.

---

# What is a Convolution?

Convolution means

> Sliding a small filter over an image to detect patterns.

Example

```
Image

□□□□□□□□

Kernel

■■■
■■■
■■■

↓

Move

↓

Move

↓

Move
```

Instead of looking at the whole image,

CNN looks at

small regions.

---

# What is a Kernel (Filter)?

Kernel

=

Small Matrix

Example

```
3 × 3

5 × 5

7 × 7
```

Example

```
1 0 -1

1 0 -1

1 0 -1
```

This kernel detects

Vertical Edges.

Different kernels learn

- Edges
- Corners
- Curves
- Textures
- Shapes

---

# Feature Map

After convolution,

we get

```
Feature Map
```

Example

```
Image

↓

Convolution

↓

Feature Map
```

The feature map highlights

important regions

of the image.

---

# Stride

Stride

means

```
How many pixels

the filter moves.
```

Example

Stride = 1

```
□□□□□

■■■

↓

Move

1 Pixel
```

Stride = 2

```
Move

2 Pixels
```

Higher Stride

↓

Smaller Output

↓

Less Computation

---

# Padding

Without Padding

Image Size

keeps shrinking.

Example

```
5 × 5

↓

3 × 3

↓

1 × 1
```

Padding

adds

Zeros

around

the image.

Example

```
000000

011110

011110

011110

000000
```

Advantages

✅ Preserve Image Size

✅ Better Edge Detection

---

# Pooling

Pooling

reduces

image size

while preserving

important information.

Benefits

- Faster Training
- Less Memory
- Less Overfitting

---

# Max Pooling

Most common pooling.

Example

```
2 5

7 1

↓

7
```

PyTorch

```python
pool = nn.MaxPool2d(

kernel_size=2,

stride=2
)
```

---

# Average Pooling

Instead of

Maximum

calculate

Average.

```
2 4

6 8

↓

5
```

Used less often than Max Pooling.

# 📖 Story

Imagine you are reading this sentence

```
I grew up in France.

I speak fluent ______.
```

Can you guess the missing word?

Probably

```

How?

Because

your brain remembers

the previous sentence.

Now imagine a neural network.

It receives

```
I

↓

↓

France
```

If it forgets the previous words,

it cannot predict

```
French.
```

Unlike images,

This prevents

very large updates.

# Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

LSTM was introduced

to solve

the vanishing gradient problem.

Instead of

one memory,

it maintains

```
Hidden State

+

Cell State
```

Cell State

acts like

long-term memory.

# Why LSTM Works Better

Instead of

forgetting everything,

LSTM learns

what to

remember

and

what to forget.

This allows it to model

long-term dependencies

much better than a basic RNN.

---

# GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)

GRU

is a simplified

LSTM.

It has

```
Update Gate

Reset Gate
```

instead of

three gates.

Advantages

- Faster
- Fewer Parameters
- Less Memory
- Easier Training

# RNN vs LSTM vs GRU

| Feature | RNN | LSTM | GRU |

| Memory | Small | Long-Term | Long-Term |
| Vanishing Gradient | Yes | Mostly Solved | Mostly Solved |
| Speed | Fast | Slower | Faster |

# Summary

- RNNs process sequential data by maintaining a hidden state.
- Vanilla RNNs struggle with long-term dependencies because of the vanishing gradient problem.
- LSTMs introduce cell states and gates to preserve important information over long sequences.
- GRUs simplify LSTMs while retaining much of their performance.
- Although Transformers dominate modern NLP, RNNs remain useful for understanding sequence modeling and are still applied in some time-series and resource-constrained scenarios.

# Module 16 — Attention Mechanism

# Part 1 — Why Was Attention Invented?

---

# Story

Imagine you are reading a book.

The first sentence is

```
John was born in France.
```

Now imagine

after 500 pages

you read

```
He speaks fluent French.
```

Who is

"He"?

Your brain immediately remembers

```
John

↓

France

↓

French
```

Humans can remember

information from far away.

But older neural networks

couldn't.

That was one of the biggest problems in Deep Learning.

---

# Before Transformers

Before GPT

before Llama

before BERT

the NLP world looked like

```
RNN

↓

LSTM

↓

GRU
```

These models processed

one word

at a time.

Example

```
I

↓

Love

↓

Deep

↓

Learning
```

Word by word.

---

# Sequential Processing

Sentence

```
I Love AI
```

Processing

```
I

↓

Love

↓

AI
```

The model

cannot process

"AI"

until

"I"

and

"Love"

are finished.

Problem

```
Slow Training
```

---

# Long Sentences

Imagine

```
1000 words
```

The first word

must travel

through

999 steps

before reaching

the last word.

During this journey

information slowly disappears.

This is called

```
Long Range Dependency Problem
```

---

# Example

Sentence

```
The animal didn't cross the road because it was too tired.
```

Question

What is

```
it
```

referring to?

```
Animal

or

Road?
```

Humans instantly know

```
Animal
```

Old RNNs

often failed.

---

# Encoder Decoder

Researchers invented

Encoder Decoder Networks.

```

Example

```

```

---

# The Bottleneck Problem

Imagine

this sentence

```
The weather in Mumbai is beautiful today and I want to go to Marine Drive with my friends because the sunset looks amazing after the rain...
```

The encoder

must compress

the entire sentence

into

one vector.

```
100 words

↓

One Vector

↓

Decoder
```

This is like

trying to compress

an entire movie

into

one photograph.

Impossible.

---

# Information Loss

As sentence length increases

```
Sentence Length

↑

↓

Accuracy

↓

Drops
```

Long sentences

became difficult

to translate.

Researchers realized

something important.

Instead of

remembering

everything,

what if

the decoder

looked back

at the important words?

That simple idea

changed AI forever.

---

# Birth of Attention

Instead of saying

```
Remember Everything
```

Attention says

```
Remember

Only

What Matters

Right Now.
```

Example

Sentence

```
The cat sat on the chair.
```

When predicting

```
chair
```

Should the model

look equally

at every word?

```
The

Cat

Sat

On

Chair
```

No.

It mainly needs

```
Sat

On

Chair
```

Attention

lets the model

focus

on

important words

instead of

every word equally.

---

# Human Analogy

Suppose someone asks

```
Where do you live?
```

Does your brain

remember

```
Your First Birthday?

Class 5 Exam?

Yesterday's Breakfast?
```

No.

It immediately

retrieves

only

the relevant memory.

That

is exactly

what Attention does.

---

```

Attention

```
Word1 ←→ Word4

Word2 ←→ Word3

Word1 ←→ Word2

```

Every word

can directly communicate

with every other word.

---

# Key Takeaways

✅ RNNs process words sequentially.

✅ Long sentences cause information loss.

✅ Encoder-Decoder models suffer from bottlenecks.

✅ Attention removes this bottleneck.

✅ Every modern LLM is built on the Attention mechanism.

# Coming Next...

Now comes the most important topic in Deep Learning.

We'll answer:

```
What are

Query?

Key?

Value?

```

and why these three vectors

are the heart

of every Transformer.



# Module 16 – Attention Mechanism

# 📖 Story

Imagine you're inside a huge library.

The library contains

```
10 Million Books
```

Now you ask the librarian

```
"I want a book about Deep Learning."
```

What happens?

The librarian does **NOT**

read

```
Book 1

Book 2

Book 3

...

Book 10 Million
```

Instead,

the librarian does three things.

---

## Step 1

Understand

what you are looking for.

```
Deep Learning
```

This is called

```
Query
```

---

## Step 2

Look at

every book's label.

```
Mathematics

History

Physics

AI

Cooking

Biology
```

These labels are

```
Keys
```

---

## Step 3

Once the correct book is found,

give you

the actual book.

That book is

```

# What is Query?

Query means

> **What am I looking for?**

Example

Sentence

```
The cat sat on the chair.
```

Suppose we are processing

```
chair
```

The model asks

```
Which previous words

are important

for understanding

"chair"?
```

That question

is

```
Query
```

---

# What is Key?

Every word

contains

a label.

Example

```
The

↓

Article

----------------

Cat

↓

Animal

----------------

Sat

↓

Action

----------------

Chair

↓

Object
```

These labels

are called

```
Keys
```

Keys tell the model

what information

each word contains.

---

# What is Value?

Once

the model finds

important words,

it retrieves

their information.

That information

is called

```
Value
```

Think of

```
Key

↓

Address

----------------

Value

↓

Actual House
```

---

# Human Brain Analogy

Suppose someone asks

```
Where did you complete your graduation?
```

Your brain doesn't search

every memory equally.

Instead,

it creates

```
Query

↓

Graduation
```

Then

it searches memories

```
School

College

Friends

Movies

Travel
```

Finally

it retrieves

```
Walchand College
```

Exactly

how Attention works.

---

# Example

Sentence

```
The dog chased the ball because it was fast.
```

Question

Who is

```

```

Then compares

Finally

it realizes

```

Notice

Same embedding

Different projections.

---

# Why Three Different Matrices?

Question

Why not

```
Query = Key = Value ?
```

Because

each vector

has

a different job.

| Vector | Purpose |
|---------|----------|
| Query | What am I searching for? |
| Key | What information do I have? |
| Value | What information should I send? |

---

# Example

Sentence

```
Virat Kohli plays cricket.
```

Suppose we process

```
plays
```

Query asks

```
Who performs this action?
```

Keys

```
Virat

Kohli

Plays

Cricket
```

Attention

finds

```
Virat Kohli
```

Values

contain

information about

Virat Kohli

which is used

to understand

the sentence.

---

# Similarity

How does the model know

which Key

matches

the Query?

It computes

```
Similarity Score
```

Higher Score

↓

More Attention

Lower Score

↓

Less Attention

---

# Dot Product

The simplest similarity measure

is

```
Dot Product
```

Suppose

```
Query

=

[1 2]

Key

=

[3 4]
```

Dot Product

```
1×3

+

2×4

=

11
```

Large number

↓

High Similarity

Small number

↓

Low Similarity

---

# Example

Query

```
[1,0]
```

Key A

```
[1,0]
```

Dot Product

```
1
```

Key B

```
[0,1]
```

Dot Product

```
0
```

Clearly

Key A

matches better.

---

# But There's a Problem...

Suppose

Embedding Size

becomes

```
4096
```

Dot Products

become

very large.

Large numbers

cause

Softmax

to become unstable.

Solution?

Divide

by

```
√d
```

where

```
d

=

Embedding Dimension
```

This is called

```
Scaled Dot Product Attention
```

We'll study it

in the next chapter.

---

# PyTorch Example

Let's create

Query

Key

and

Value.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

embedding_dim = 512

sequence_length = 8

batch_size = 2

x = torch.randn(

# The Attention Formula

The complete Attention equation is

It compares

```
Cat

↓

---

# Step 3

Scale

the Scores

Suppose

√dₖ
```

```
QKᵀ

────────

√dₖ
```

Example

```
Embedding

```

So

instead of

```
160
```

we compute

```
160 / 8

```

This keeps values

within

a reasonable range.

# Why Scaling Works

# Self-Attention vs Multi-Head Attention

| Self-Attention | Multi-Head Attention |

| One Attention | Multiple Attentions |
| One Perspective | Multiple Perspectives |
| Simpler | More Powerful |
| Lower Capacity | Higher Capacity |

---

# Real Example

```

Head 2

focuses on

```
Released

↓

```

Head 3

```

Combining

all heads

creates

a richer understanding.

---

# Why It Works

Instead of asking

one question

about the sentence,

the model asks

many questions

at the same time.

This makes

Transformers

much more expressive.

---

# Applications

Multi-Head Attention

is used in

- GPT
- BERT
- Llama
- Gemma
- Qwen
- DeepSeek
- Vision Transformers
- CLIP
- Whisper

---

# Best Practices

✅ Embedding Dimension should be divisible by Number of Heads.

Example

```
512

↓

8 Heads

↓

64 per Head
```

---

✅ Use multiple heads

instead of one

for better representations.

---

✅ Keep head dimensions balanced.

---

# Common Mistakes

❌ Embedding size

not divisible

by heads.

---

❌ Confusing

Self-Attention

with

Multi-Head Attention.

---

❌ Forgetting

the final

output projection.

# 📖 Story

Imagine I give you this sentence.

```
I love AI
```

Now imagine I shuffle it.

```
AI love I
```

Both sentences contain

the same words.

But

their meanings

are different.

Humans understand

because

we know

the position

of every word.

A Transformer

doesn't.

Without positional information,

it simply sees

```
I

Love

AI
```

as

three vectors.

It has

no idea

which word came first.

---

# Why Doesn't Attention Know Order?

Attention

compares

every word

with every other word.

It doesn't know

whether

```
Dog

↓

before

↓

Runs
```

or

```
Runs

↓

before

↓

Dog
```

Without extra information,

both look similar.

---

# The Problem

Sentence 1

```
Dog bites man.
```

Sentence 2

```
Man bites dog.
```

Same words.

Different order.

Different meaning.

Attention alone

cannot distinguish

between them.

---

# Solution

Add

position information

to every word.

# Sinusoidal Positional Encoding

The original Transformer paper

introduced

fixed

Sinusoidal Encoding.

Instead of learning

positions,

they are computed

using

```
Sine

and

Cosine
```

functions.

Formula

\[
PE(pos,2i)=\sin\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d}}\right)
\]

\[
PE(pos,2i+1)=\cos\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d}}\right)
\]

Don't worry

about memorizing

the formula.

The important idea is

```
Different Positions

↓

Different Patterns
```

---

# Why Sine and Cosine?

Because

they create

smooth

continuous

patterns.

Nearby positions

have similar encodings,

while distant positions

look different.

This helps the model

understand

relative positions.

---

# Example

Suppose

Embedding Size

```
4
```

Position

```
0

↓

[0,1,0,1]
```

Position

```
1

↓

[0.84,0.54,0.01,0.99]
```

Position

```
2

↓

Different Values
```

Each position

gets

a unique pattern.

---

# Adding Position

Suppose

Embedding

```
[0.2

0.7

0.1

0.5]
```

Position Encoding

```
[0.8

0.3

0.2

0.4]
```

Final Input

```
[1.0

1.0

0.3

0.9]
```

This

combined vector

is sent

to the Transformer.

---

# Learned Positional Embeddings

Instead of

using

fixed formulas,

the model

learns

position vectors.

```
Position

↓

Embedding Table

↓

Learned Position
```

Advantages

- More Flexible
- Learns Task-Specific Positions

Used in

- BERT
- GPT-2 (absolute learned position embeddings)

---

# Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE)

Modern LLMs

rarely use

the original sinusoidal method.

Instead

they use

```
RoPE
```

RoPE

rotates

Query

and

Key

vectors

based on position.

Instead of adding

position,

it modifies

the attention computation itself.

---

# Why RoPE?

Advantages

✅ Better Long Context

✅ Better Generalization

✅ Relative Position Awareness

Used in

- Llama
- Qwen
- DeepSeek
- Gemma
- Mistral

---

# ALiBi

Another modern method.

Instead of

adding embeddings,

ALiBi

adds

a distance-based bias

to attention scores.

Advantages

- Better Long Sequences
- No Extra Position Embeddings
- Simple Implementation

---

# Comparison

| Method | Learnable | Used In |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Sinusoidal | ❌ | Original Transformer |
| Learned Position | ✅ | BERT, GPT-2 |
| RoPE | Partial (rotational transformation with fixed frequencies) | Llama, Qwen, Gemma, DeepSeek |
| ALiBi | ❌ | Some Long-Context Models |

---

# PyTorch Example

Learned Positional Embedding

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

max_length = 512

embedding_dim = 768

position_embedding = nn.Embedding(

    max_length,

    embedding_dim

)

positions = torch.arange(

    0,

    10

)

pos = position_embedding(

    positions

)

print(pos.shape)
```

Output

```
torch.Size([10,768])
```

---

# Adding Position to Tokens

```python
token_embedding = torch.randn(

10,

768

)

final_embedding = (

token_embedding

+

pos

)
```

Now

every token

```
The

```

and

```

```

would be difficult to distinguish.

Position Encoding

solves

this problem.

---

# Relation with Attention

Attention

answers

```
Which word

should I focus on?
```

Positional Encoding

```
Where is this word?
```

Together,

they allow the model

to understand

both

and

order.

---

# Best Practices

✅ Always include positional information in Transformer inputs.

✅ Choose a positional encoding method that matches your architecture.

✅ RoPE is widely used in modern decoder-only LLMs.

---

# Common Mistakes

❌ Assuming attention alone understands sequence order.

❌ Confusing token embeddings with positional embeddings.

❌ Assuming all Transformer models use the same positional encoding strategy.

# Summary

- Self-attention alone does not understand token order.
- Positional Encoding injects sequence information into the model.
- The original Transformer used fixed sinusoidal encodings.
- Many modern models use learned positional embeddings or RoPE.
- RoPE has become the standard choice for many decoder-only LLMs because it captures relative position information effectively.

# Summary

- Transformers replaced RNNs with attention-based architectures.
- The original Transformer consists of an Encoder and a Decoder.
- Residual connections and Layer Normalization enable stable deep networks.
- Feed Forward Networks process each token independently after attention.
- Modern LLMs such as GPT, Llama, Gemma, and Qwen are primarily decoder-only Transformers.
- BERT is encoder-only, while T5 and BART use both encoder and decoder.

```

automatically.

---

# AutoTokenizer

Every model

has

its own tokenizer.

Instead of

remembering

different classes,

we use

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
```

Example

```python
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(

    "gpt2"

)
```

---

# Tokenization

Sentence

```
I love AI
```

becomes

```
[40,

1842,

9552]
```

The model

understands

numbers,

not words.

---

# Encoding Text

```python
text = "Hello World"

tokens = tokenizer(

    text,

    return_tensors="pt"

)

print(tokens)
```

Output

contains

```
input_ids

```

---

# Decoding

```python
sentence = tokenizer.decode(

    tokens["input_ids"][0]

)

print(sentence)
```

Converts

numbers

back

into text.

---

# AutoModel

Loads

the base Transformer

without

any task-specific head.

```python
from transformers import AutoModel

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(

    "bert-base-uncased"

)
```

Used mainly for

feature extraction

and embeddings.

---

# AutoModelForCausalLM

Negative
```

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(

    "bert-base-uncased",

    num_labels=2

)
```

---

# AutoModelForTokenClassification

Used for

Named Entity Recognition.

Example

```
John

Person

Paris

↓

Location
```

---

# Loading Llama

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

model_name = "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

---

# Loading Gemma

```python
model_name = "google/gemma-2-2b"

---

# Generating Text

```python
inputs = tokenizer(

    "Artificial Intelligence",

    return_tensors="pt"

)

outputs = model.generate(

    **inputs,

    max_new_tokens=50

)

print(

    tokenizer.decode(

        outputs[0],

        skip_special_tokens=True

    )
)
```

---

# Chat Templates

Modern chat models

expect

structured conversations.

Example

```python
messages = [

    {

        "role":"user",

        "content":"Explain AI"

    }

]

prompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(

    messages,

    tokenize=False,

    add_generation_prompt=True

)
```

This formats the conversation in the way the model expects.

---

# Device Mapping

Large models

may not fit

on one GPU.

Hugging Face

can automatically

place layers

on available hardware.

```python
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(

    model_name,

    device_map="auto"

)
```

# 📖 Story

Imagine you meet someone who only understands numbers.

You say

```
Hello
```

They don't understand.

Instead,

you create a dictionary.

```
Hello

↓

1254

World

↓

998

AI

↓

4521
```

Now,

instead of sending

```
Hello AI
```

you send

```
1254

4521
```

The person understands.

LLMs work exactly the same way.

They **never read text directly.**

They only understand

```
Numbers
```

---

# Why Tokenization?

Computers cannot understand

```
Hello

World

Artificial Intelligence
```

They understand

```
124

522

890
```

So,

before text enters

the model,

it must be

converted into

numbers.

This process is called

```
Tokenization
```

---

# Character-Level Tokenization

Every character

becomes one token.

Example

```
Hello
```

↓

```
H

e

l

l

o
```

Advantages

- Small Vocabulary

Disadvantages

- Very Long Sequences

---

# Word-Level Tokenization

Each word

becomes

one token.

Example

```
I Love AI
```

↓

```
I

Love

AI
```

Advantages

- Short Sequences

Disadvantages

Unknown words become a problem.

Example

```
ChatGPT123XYZ
```

The tokenizer

may not recognize it.

---

# Subword Tokenization

Modern LLMs

use

```
Subwords
```

instead of

characters

or

complete words.

Example

```
Unbelievable
```

↓

```
Un

believ

able
```

Advantages

✅ Smaller Vocabulary

✅ Handles New Words

✅ Better Generalization

---

# Vocabulary

Vocabulary

is

the complete list

of known tokens.

Example

| Token | ID |
|-------|----|
| Hello | 101 |
| AI | 205 |
| World | 999 |

Vocabulary size

depends

on the model.

Examples

| Model | Vocabulary |
|---------|------------|
| GPT-2 | ~50K |
| BERT | ~30K |
| Llama | ~128K |
| Gemma | ~256K (varies by version) |

---

# Token IDs

Sentence

```
Hello World
```

↓

```
101

999
```

These numbers

are sent

to the model.

---

# Embeddings

Token IDs

don't contain

meaning.

Embedding Layer

converts

them

into vectors.

```
101

↓

[0.23

-0.55

...]

```

Now

the Transformer

can process them.

---

# Special Tokens

Most tokenizers

use

special tokens.

| Token | Purpose |
|---------|----------|
| `[PAD]` | Padding |
| `[CLS]` | Classification |
| `[SEP]` | Separator |
| `[MASK]` | Masked Language Modeling |
| `<bos>` | Beginning of Sentence |
| `<eos>` | End of Sentence |

Different models

use

different tokens.

---

# Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)

One of

the most popular

tokenization algorithms.

Used by

- GPT-2
- RoBERTa
- Many GPT-style models

Idea

Start

with

characters.

Gradually

merge

frequently occurring pairs.

Example

```
L

o

w
```

↓

```
Lo

↓

Low
```

Frequently occurring combinations

become

single tokens.

---

# WordPiece

Developed by Google.

Used in

```
BERT
```

Example

```
Playing
```

↓

```
Play

##

ing
```

The prefix

```
##
```

means

continuation

of the previous token.

---

# SentencePiece

Created by Google.

Unlike

BPE,

it doesn't require

splitting

on spaces first.

Used in

- T5
- ALBERT
- Llama (SentencePiece-based tokenizer)

Works well

for multilingual

languages.

---

# Unigram Tokenizer

Instead of

merging tokens,

it starts

with

many candidates

and

removes

less useful ones.

Used in

some modern models.

---

# Comparison

| Algorithm | Used By |
|------------|----------|
| BPE | GPT-2 |
| WordPiece | BERT |
| SentencePiece | T5, Llama |
| Unigram | Some multilingual models |

---

# Tokenization Example

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(

    "gpt2"

)

text = "I love Artificial Intelligence."

tokens = tokenizer(text)

print(tokens)
```

Output

```
input_ids

attention_mask
```

---

# Decoding

```python
decoded = tokenizer.decode(

    tokens["input_ids"]

)

print(decoded)
```

Numbers

↓

Back

to

text.

---

# Padding

Suppose

Sentence A

```
I Love AI
```

Sentence B

```
Artificial Intelligence is changing the world.
```

Different lengths.

Models

prefer

uniform batch shapes.

Padding

adds

extra tokens.

Example

```
I Love AI [PAD] [PAD]
```

---

# Padding in Hugging Face

```python
tokenizer(

    text,

    padding=True

)
```

---

# Truncation

Suppose

Maximum Length

```
128 Tokens
```

Input

contains

```
500 Tokens
```

The tokenizer

cuts

the extra tokens.

```python
tokenizer(

    text,

    truncation=True

)
```

---

# Attention Mask

Padding

should not

affect

predictions.

Attention Mask

tells

the model

which tokens

are real.

Example

Sentence

```
Hello World PAD PAD
```

Mask

```
1

1

0

0
```

Meaning

```
1

Real Token

0

Ignore
```

---

# Context Window

Every LLM

has

a maximum

number

of tokens

it can process.

Examples

| Model | Approximate Context |
|---------|---------------------|
| GPT-2 | 1024 |
| Llama 2 | 4096 |
| Llama 3 | Larger than Llama 2 (varies by version) |
| Gemma | Model-dependent |
| Qwen | Model-dependent |

Longer context

↓

More memory

↓

Higher computation.

# Complete Example

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(

    "gpt2"

)

text = "Transformers changed AI forever."

encoded = tokenizer(

    text,

    truncation=True,

    return_tensors="pt"

)

print(encoded["input_ids"])

print(encoded["attention_mask"])

# Best Practices

✅ Use the tokenizer that matches the model.

✅ Enable truncation for long inputs.

✅ Use attention masks with padded sequences.

✅ Be aware of the model's context window.

---

# Common Mistakes

❌ Using the wrong tokenizer.

Later,

they are loaded

from the local cache.

---

# Local Cache

Downloaded models

are stored

locally.

Benefits

- Faster Loading
- Offline Usage
- No Re-download

---

# Uploading a Model

Suppose

you fine-tuned

Llama.

Save it

```python
model.save_pretrained(

    "./my_model"

)

tokenizer.save_pretrained(

    "./my_model"

)
```

Upload

```python
from huggingface_hub import upload_folder

upload_folder(

    folder_path="./my_model",

    repo_id="username/my_model",

# Model Card

Every model

should include

documentation.

Model Card

contains

- Description
- Training Data
- Intended Use
- Limitations
- License
- Metrics

Usually written

in

```
README.md
```

---

# Example Model Card

```markdown
# Medical Assistant

Base Model

Llama 3.2

Dataset

Medical QA

Language

English

License

Apache-2.0
```

---

# Dataset Card

Every dataset

should describe

- Source
- Size
- Labels
- Preprocessing
- License

This improves

reproducibility

and transparency.

---

# Model Files

Typical repository

contains

```
config.json

tokenizer.json

tokenizer_config.json

special_tokens_map.json

model.safetensors

generation_config.json

README.md
```

---

# What is config.json?

Contains

model architecture.

Example

```
Hidden Size

Layers

Heads

Vocabulary Size
```

Without it,

the model

cannot be reconstructed correctly.

---

# What is tokenizer.json?

Stores

the tokenizer

configuration

and vocabulary.

Must match

the model.

---

# What is generation_config.json?

Stores

default generation settings.

Example

```
Temperature

Top-p

Max Tokens

EOS Token
```

---

# What is .safetensors?

Modern models

are usually stored as

```
model.safetensors
```

instead of

```
pytorch_model.bin
```

Advantages

✅ Faster Loading

✅ Safe Format

✅ No Pickle Execution

Preferred

for modern

LLMs.

---

# Why Safetensors?

Older

```
.bin
```

files

may rely on Python's pickle mechanism.

`.safetensors`

stores tensors

without executing arbitrary code during loading,

making it a safer format for sharing models.

---

# Model Versioning

Example

```

# 📖 Story

Imagine

you bought

a Ferrari.

Now

you want

to change

its color.

Would you

rebuild

the entire car?

```
Engine

Transmission

Tyres

Seats

Battery
```

No.

You simply

paint

the body.

Small change.

Huge impact.

LLM Fine-Tuning

works exactly

the same way.

Instead of

changing

billions

of parameters,

we only

train

a very small part.

This idea

is called

```
PEFT
```

---

# Before PEFT

Suppose

Llama 7B

contains

```
7 Billion Parameters
```

Traditional Fine-Tuning

updates

all

```
7 Billion
```

parameters.

Problems

❌ Huge GPU Memory

❌ Expensive

❌ Slow

❌ Large Checkpoints

---

# Example

Suppose

a model has

```
7,000,000,000

Parameters
```

Each parameter

is stored

using

```
16 Bits

(2 Bytes)
```

Memory

```
≈14 GB

Only

Weights
```

During training

Optimizer States

Gradients

Activations

also consume memory.

Actual memory

can become

```
40–80 GB+

```

depending on

the optimizer

and training setup.

---

# Why Full Fine-Tuning is Difficult?

Suppose

you have

```
RTX 3060

12 GB
```

Can you

fully fine-tune

```
Llama-7B
```

No.

Memory

is not enough.

---

# Solution

Freeze

almost

everything.

Train

only

a few parameters.

```
7 Billion

↓

5 Million

↓

Training
```

This is

Parameter Efficient

Fine-Tuning.

---

# What is PEFT?

PEFT means

```
Parameter

Efficient

Fine-Tuning
```

Instead of

training

the whole model,

we train

only

small additional

parameters.

# Prompt Tuning

Idea

Instead of

changing

the model,

learn

special prompt vectors.

```
Prompt

```

Only

the prompt

is trained.

---

# Prefix Tuning

Instead of

training

the whole model,

learn

small

prefix vectors

that are added

to each Transformer layer.

---

# P-Tuning

An improved

version

of Prompt Tuning.

Uses

learnable embeddings

instead of

hand-written prompts.

---

# Adapters

Small neural networks

are inserted

between

Transformer layers.

```
Transformer

↓

Adapter

↓

Transformer
```

Only

Adapters

are trained.

---

# IA³

IA³ stands for

```
Infused Adapter

by

Inhibiting

and

Amplifying

Inner Activations
```

Instead of

adding

new layers,

it learns

small scaling vectors

inside

the Transformer.

Advantages

- Very few trainable parameters
- Low memory usage

---

# LoRA (Introduction)

LoRA

is

the most popular

PEFT method.

Instead of

updating

the original

weight matrix

```
W
```

LoRA learns

a small update

```
ΔW
```

Final weight

becomes

```
W + ΔW
```

Original model

remains

unchanged.

We'll study

LoRA

in the next module.

---

# PEFT Library

Install

```bash
pip install peft
```

Import

```python
from peft import (
    get_peft_model,
    LoraConfig
)
```

The PEFT library

provides

implementations

of

- LoRA
- Prompt Tuning
- Prefix Tuning
- IA³
- AdaLoRA

---

# Example

Load

a pretrained model

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(

    "gpt2"

)
```

Freeze

all parameters

```python
for param in model.parameters():

    param.requires_grad = False
```

Now

only

PEFT layers

will learn.

---

# Checking Trainable Parameters

```python
trainable = sum(

    p.numel()

    for p in model.parameters()

    if p.requires_grad

)

total = sum(

    p.numel()

    for p in model.parameters()

)

print(

    f"Trainable: {trainable:,}"

)

print(

    f"Total: {total:,}"

)
```

This is

commonly printed

before training

to verify

that only

the intended parameters

are trainable.

---

# Full Fine-Tuning vs PEFT

# 📖 Story

Imagine

you own

a huge library.

```
10 Million Books
```

Now

one book

contains

a spelling mistake.

Would you

rewrite

the entire library?

No.

You only

change

that one page.

LoRA works

exactly

the same way.

Instead of

changing

billions

of parameters,

it learns

a very small correction.

# Matrix Refresher

Suppose

```
W

=

4096 × 4096
```

Number of Parameters

```
16 Million+
```

Training

all of them

is expensive.

---

# Low Rank

Instead of

learning

```
4096 × 4096
```

LoRA learns

two smaller matrices.

```
A

↓

4096 × r

B

↓

r × 4096
```

where

```
r

<<

4096
```

Example

```
r = 16
```

Now

far fewer parameters

need training.

---

# LoRA Formula

Instead of

updating

```
W
```

we compute

\[
W' = W + BA
\]

where

- **W** = Frozen pretrained weights
- **A** and **B** = Trainable low-rank matrices

Only

```
A

and

B
```

are updated.

---

# Why Does It Work?

The pretrained model

already contains

most of

the knowledge.

LoRA only learns

the small adjustment

required

for the new task.

Think of it as

```
Base Knowledge

+

Small Correction

↓

New Skill
```

---

# Understanding Rank (r)

Rank

controls

the size

of

LoRA matrices.

Example

```
r = 4

↓

Very Small

↓

Less Memory

↓

Lower Capacity
```

```
r = 64

↓

More Parameters

↓

Better Learning

↓

Higher Memory
```

Typical values

```
8

16

32

64
```

---

# Alpha (α)

Alpha

controls

the strength

of the LoRA update.

Effective scaling

is approximately

\[
\frac{\alpha}{r}
\]

Example

```
r = 16

α = 32

Scaling = 2
```

Higher alpha

gives

LoRA updates

more influence.

---

# LoRA Dropout

Dropout

helps

prevent

overfitting.

```python
lora_dropout = 0.05
```

Typical values

```
0.0

0.05

0.1
```

---

# Target Modules

LoRA

is usually applied

to

attention layers.

Common targets

```
q_proj

k_proj

v_proj

o_proj
```

Some models

also fine-tune

```
gate_proj

up_proj

from peft import LoraConfig

config = LoraConfig(

    r=16,

    lora_alpha=32,

    lora_dropout=0.05,

    bias="none",

    task_type="CAUSAL_LM",

    target_modules=[

        "q_proj",

        "v_proj"

    ]

)
```

---

# Understanding Parameters

|------------|----------|
| r | Rank |
| lora_alpha | Scaling Factor |
| lora_dropout | Regularization |

# Loading Base Model

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(

    "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B"

)
```

---

# Apply LoRA

```python
from peft import get_peft_model

model = get_peft_model(

    model,

    config

)
```

Done.

LoRA

has now

been added

to the model.

---

# Verify Trainable Parameters

```python
model.print_trainable_parameters()
```

Example Output

```
trainable params:

4,194,304

all params:

1,236,000,000

trainable%

0.34%
```

Only

a tiny fraction

of parameters

are trained.

---

# Training Loop

```python
from transformers import Trainer

trainer = Trainer(

    model=model,

    train_dataset=train_dataset,

    args=training_args

)

trainer.train()
```

LoRA

works

with

the standard

Hugging Face

training pipeline.

---

# Saving LoRA

```python
model.save_pretrained(

    "./lora_adapter"

)
```

Notice

only

the adapter

is saved.

Not

the entire

LLM.

---

# Loading LoRA

```python
from peft import PeftModel

base_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(

    "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B"

)

model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(

    base_model,

    "./lora_adapter"

)
```

The base model

and adapter

are combined

during loading.

---

# Merging LoRA

Sometimes

you want

a standalone model.

```python
merged_model = model.merge_and_unload()
```

Now

the LoRA weights

are merged

into

for neural networks.

Instead of storing

large numbers,

it stores

smaller ones.

Less memory.

Faster loading.

Cheaper training.

# What is Quantization?

Quantization means

storing numbers

using fewer bits.

Example

| Format | Bits |
|----------|------|
| FP32 | 32 |
| FP16 | 16 |
| INT8 | 8 |
| INT4 | 4 |

Fewer bits

↓

Less memory.

---

# Memory Example

Suppose

a model has

```
7 Billion Parameters
```

Approximate memory

| Format | Memory |
|----------|---------|
| FP32 | ~28 GB |
| FP16 | ~14 GB |
| INT8 | ~7 GB |
| INT4 | ~3.5 GB |

This is why

4-bit models

can fit

on consumer GPUs.

---

# Why Not Train INT4?

Question

```
If INT4

is so small,

why not

train

everything

in INT4?
```

Answer

Because

training

needs

high precision.

QLoRA

stores

weights

in

4-bit,

but

important computations

are still performed

using higher precision

(e.g., FP16 or BF16 depending on the setup).

# NF4 Quantization

QLoRA

introduced

```
NF4

Normal Float 4
```

Instead of

ordinary INT4,

NF4

is designed

specifically

for neural network

weights.

Advantages

✅ Better Accuracy

✅ Better Compression

Used in

almost all

QLoRA training.

---

# Double Quantization

Another innovation

in QLoRA.

Instead of

only quantizing

the weights,

the quantization constants

are also compressed.

Benefits

- Saves additional memory
- Minimal accuracy loss

---

# BitsAndBytes

QLoRA

uses

```
bitsandbytes
```

for loading

4-bit models.

Install

```bash
pip install bitsandbytes
```

---

# BitsAndBytesConfig

```python
from transformers import BitsAndBytesConfig

bnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(

    load_in_4bit=True,

    bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4",

    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,

    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype="bfloat16"

)
```

---

# Parameter Explanation

| Parameter | Meaning |
|------------|----------|
| load_in_4bit | Load model in 4-bit |
| quant_type | NF4 Quantization |
| double_quant | Extra Compression |
| compute_dtype | Computation Precision |

---

# Loading a Quantized Model

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(

    "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B",

    quantization_config=bnb_config,

    device_map="auto"

)
```

Now

the model

is loaded

in

4-bit.

---

# Add LoRA

```python
from peft import get_peft_model

model = get_peft_model(

    model,

    lora_config

)
```

The base model

stays frozen.

Only

LoRA

learns.

# 📖 Story

Imagine

you have

a student

who has already

completed

```
School

↓

College

↓

University
```

Now

you want

to make

them

a doctor.

Would you

teach

```
ABC

again?
```

No.

You only

teach

```
Medicine
```

LLMs

work

the same way.

A pretrained model

already knows

- English
- Programming
- Mathematics
- Science

Now

we teach

it

how to

follow instructions.

This process

is called

```
Supervised Fine-Tuning

(SFT)
```

# What is TRL?

TRL

stands for

```
Transformer

Reinforcement

Learning
```

Despite its name,

TRL is also widely used for

Supervised Fine-Tuning.

It provides

- SFTTrainer
- PPOTrainer
- DPOTrainer
- RewardTrainer

```

Example

```
Question

↓

Answer
```

---

# Example Dataset

```text
Instruction:

What is AI?

Response:

Artificial Intelligence is...
```

The model

learns

to generate

the response.

---

# Pretraining vs SFT

| Pretraining | SFT |
|-------------|-----|
| Predict Next Token | Follow Instructions |
| Huge Dataset | Task Dataset |
| Trillions of Tokens | Thousands / Millions |
| Very Expensive | Affordable |

---

# Instruction Tuning

Instead of

plain text

we use

structured examples.

Example

```text
Instruction:

Translate to French

Input:

Hello

Output:

Bonjour
```

The model

learns

to respond

to instructions.

---

# Chat Format

Modern LLMs

expect

chat-style data.

Example

```text
User:

Explain AI

Assistant:

Artificial Intelligence...
```

This is

how

ChatGPT,

Llama,

Gemma,

and

Qwen

are trained.

---

# Chat Template

Example

```python
messages = [

{

"role":"user",

"content":"Explain AI"

},

{

"role":"assistant",

"content":"Artificial Intelligence..."

}

]
```

The tokenizer

formats

the conversation

before training.

---

# Loading Dataset

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset(

    "json",

    data_files="train.json"

)
```

---

# Loading Model

```python
from unsloth import FastLanguageModel

model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(

    model_name="unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B",

    load_in_4bit=True,

    max_seq_length=2048

)
```

---

# Apply LoRA

```python
model = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(

    model,

    r=16,

    lora_alpha=16,

    target_modules=[

        "q_proj",

        "k_proj",

        "v_proj",

        "o_proj"

    ]

)
```

---

# SFTTrainer

The most important

class

in

TRL.

```python
from trl import SFTTrainer
```

---

# TrainingArguments

```python
from transformers import TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(

    output_dir="outputs",

    num_train_epochs=1,

    learning_rate=2e-4,

    per_device_train_batch_size=2,

    gradient_accumulation_steps=4,

    logging_steps=10,

    save_steps=100,

    bf16=True

)
```

---

# Important Parameters

| Parameter | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| learning_rate | Training Speed |
| batch_size | Samples per Batch |
| gradient_accumulation_steps | Simulate Larger Batch |
| logging_steps | Print Logs |
| save_steps | Save Checkpoints |
| bf16 | Mixed Precision |

---

# Create Trainer

```python
trainer = SFTTrainer(

    model=model,

    tokenizer=tokenizer,

    train_dataset=dataset["train"],

    args=training_args

)
```

---

# Start Training

```python
trainer.train()
```

TRL

handles

- Loss
- Optimizer
- Scheduler
- Checkpoints
- Logging

automatically.

---

# Gradient Accumulation

Suppose

GPU

can only

fit

```
Batch Size = 2
```

But

you want

```
Batch Size = 8
```

Use

```
Gradient Accumulation

=

4
```

The model

updates

weights

after

4 mini-batches,

giving an effective batch size of 8.

---

# Data Collator

A Data Collator

prepares

batches

before

training.

Responsibilities

- Padding
- Tensor Conversion
- Batch Creation

---

# Evaluation

```python
trainer.evaluate()
```

Computes

evaluation metrics

on

the validation dataset.

---

# Saving Model

```python
trainer.save_model(

    "my_adapter"

)
```

```

Useful

for

monitoring

training progress.

---

# Checkpoints

Training

can be

saved

periodically.

Example

```
Checkpoint-100

Checkpoint-200

is interrupted.

---

# Best Practices

✅ Use

instruction-style datasets.

---

✅ Keep

the validation

dataset

separate.

---

# 📖 Story

Imagine

you have

the world's

best teacher.

But

you give

him

wrong books.

Will

he become

a better teacher?

No.

Even

the smartest teacher

cannot learn

from

bad books.

LLMs

work

the same way.

```
Bad Dataset

↓

Bad Model
```

```
Good Dataset

↓

Good Model
```

In LLM training,

people often say:

> **Data quality matters more than model size.**

---

# Why Dataset Preparation?

A pretrained model

already knows

language.

During fine-tuning,

you are teaching

new behavior.

Therefore,

the quality

of your dataset

directly affects

the model's responses.

conversation pairs.

---

# Alpaca Format

One of

the most popular

instruction formats.

Example

```json
{
  "instruction": "Explain AI",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Artificial Intelligence is..."
}
```

Widely used

for

instruction tuning.

---

# ShareGPT Format

Conversation-based.

```json
[
  {
    "from":"human",
    "value":"Hello"
  },
  {
    "from":"gpt",
    "value":"Hi! How can I help?"
  }
]
```

Good for

multi-turn

chatbots.

---

# OpenAI Messages Format

Used by

ChatGPT APIs.

```json
[
  {
    "role":"system",
    "content":"You are a helpful assistant."
  },
  {
    "role":"user",
    "content":"Explain AI"
  },
  {
    "role":"assistant",
    "content":"Artificial Intelligence..."
  }
]
```

Most modern

frameworks

support

this format.

---

# Which Format Should You Choose?

| Format | Best Use |
|---------|----------|
| Alpaca | Simple Instruction Tuning |
| ShareGPT | Multi-turn Conversations |
| OpenAI Messages | Chat Models |
| Custom JSON | Domain-Specific Tasks |

---

# Chat Templates

Modern LLMs

don't train

on plain text.

Instead,

the conversation

is converted

into

a special format.

Example

```
<|user|>

Explain AI

<|assistant|>

Artificial Intelligence...
```

Different models

use

different templates.

---

# Llama Chat Template

Example

```text
<|begin_of_text|>

<|start_header_id|>user

Explain AI

<|end_header_id|>

<|start_header_id|>assistant
```

The tokenizer

creates

this automatically.

---

# Applying Chat Template

```python
messages = [

    {

        "role":"user",

        "content":"Explain AI"

    },

    {

        "role":"assistant",

        "content":"Artificial Intelligence..."

    }

]

formatted = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(

    messages,

    tokenize=False,

    add_generation_prompt=False

)

print(formatted)
```

---

# Why Chat Templates?

Without template

```
Explain AI
```

With template

```
User

↓

Assistant
```

The model

understands

conversation roles.

---

# Dataset Cleaning

Before training

remove

❌ Duplicate Examples

❌ Empty Responses

❌ Broken Text

❌ HTML Tags

❌ Random Symbols

Example

```python
dataset = dataset.filter(

    lambda x:

    len(x["output"]) > 0

)
```

---

# Dataset Splitting

Always create

```
Training

Validation

Testing
```

Example

```
80%

10%

10%
```

This helps

measure

generalization.

---

# Tokenization Pipeline

```python
def tokenize(example):

    return tokenizer(

        example["text"],

        truncation=True,

        max_length=2048

    )

dataset = dataset.map(tokenize)
```

---

# Sequence Packing

Suppose

Sentence 1

```
100 Tokens
```

Sentence 2

```
80 Tokens
```

Instead of

padding heavily,

packing combines shorter sequences to better utilize the model's context window.

Benefits

- Higher GPU utilization
- Faster training
- Less wasted padding

---

# Data Collator

Responsible for

```
Padding

↓

Batch Creation

↓

Tensor Conversion
```

Example

```python
from transformers import DataCollatorForLanguageModeling

collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(

    tokenizer,

    mlm=False

)
```

For causal language models,

`mlm=False`

is required.

---

# Hugging Face Dataset

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset(

    "json",

    data_files="train.json"

)
```

---

# Formatting Dataset

```python
def format_dataset(example):

    messages = [

        {

            "role":"user",

            "content":example["instruction"]

        },

        {

            "role":"assistant",

            "content":example["output"]

        }

    ]

    example["text"] = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(

# Common Errors

### CUDA Out of Memory

Solution

- Reduce batch size
- Reduce sequence length
- Increase gradient accumulation
- Enable 4-bit loading

---

### Loss Not Decreasing

Check

- Dataset quality
- Learning rate
- Chat template
- Tokenization
- Label formatting

---

### Poor Responses

Possible causes

- Small dataset
- Low-quality examples
- Too few training epochs
- Domain mismatch

---

# Best Practices

✅ Always validate your dataset.

✅ Keep training and validation data separate.

✅ Save checkpoints.

✅ Evaluate before deployment.

✅ Use version control for datasets and models.

# Summary

- An end-to-end fine-tuning pipeline consists of data preparation, model loading, LoRA configuration, training, evaluation, and deployment.
- Unsloth, PEFT, TRL, and Hugging Face integrate into a streamlined workflow.
- Adapters can be merged or exported depending on deployment requirements.
- GGUF enables efficient local inference with tools such as Ollama and LM Studio.
- Careful dataset preparation and evaluation are as important as model training.
